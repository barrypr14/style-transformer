<UNK> is <UNK> on this place .
this is my favorite japanese steakhouse around by far .
this place was dope .
hipster waffles are great .
its a must try .
their soups are phenomenal .
its a perfect place for lunch .
its the best in my opinion .
cold toppings is badass to say the least .
weakest <UNK> sauce in western pa .
its was so good im mean so so good .
ca n't ask for much more than that .
they charged 00 bucks to look at it .
what started poorly has turned quite well .
this experience ranks as just that .
this was no better .
not too bad a joint .
cool decor , decent food at an affordable price .
everyone of the other coaches are the same way .
had just recently replaced my others not long before .
this stadium is an absolute gem .
great gym to be at .
no complaints otherwise than the ones listed above .
pretty cool little joint overall good customer service .
it truly is 0 star .
will be back again very soon .
not too many teams offer that .
keep up the good work !
culvers is without peers in the fast food industry .
the <UNK> program is a joke .
best selection of food in the area .
so the appetizer got us excited for the mains .
i never abandon dishes .
i only got though 0/0 of that shank .
not the end of the world , but close .
wasted a pot , <UNK> .
minus one star for the grind .
this place is great for someone on a budget .
how is this place not rated higher ?
what a fantastic burger .
the star of this burger is the patty .
all in all the food was a great value .
minus one star because they charge for coffee .
two eggs , sausage , potatoes , and fruit .
potatoes are unique and flavourful .
the fried chicken is flawless .
my heart <UNK> at the thought of this burger .
why is it so damn good ?
i ' ll tell you why .
the hype is real .
am i at cora ?
this was good times .
the service here was great .
the butter chicken was bad .
' ' that about sums this course up .
got to rid the balloon taste from my mouth .
mains : thank god .
good protein makes up for everything .
great pianist and <UNK> , doing their thing .
and this place does it near perfection .
this place place makes a mean chicken parm .
the mains were the stars .
i like this place a lot .
we all had a <UNK> sandwich .
yup , i love gimmicks .
this place is worth checking out .
and that ' s all there is to it .
my family ' s dinner was very similar .
hits the spot each time .
it pays little attention to detail .
the food is great .
their burritos are fantastic .
this place deserves to be busier .
nothing special about them at all .
impressed with their honesty and the sense of pride from their workers .
greg field tempe az sprinkler doctors was a truly great experience for me .
i was quoted by another company for a $ 00,000 redo of our sprinkler system .
i was off with my wife for new years , and i took her here for lunch yesterday .
i always get the margarita pizza , but my wife insisted we get a salad , too .
i had never had any here and my wife loves chocolate , so adam suggested the <UNK> .
but , like always amazing food and spot on service .
i recently went to the joint at hard rock for a concert and was blown away .
we talked to her but she said her manager <UNK> , or something was busy .
i hope santana chooses wise and makes his residency much more professional , clean and welcoming .
this is an ` order at the counter and have it brought to your table place ' .
both the fried and <UNK> bowls , and the tenders themselves .
hands down has great customer service and there pizza is amazing along with many of their other dishes .
soba is big burrito ' s take on asian fusion .
as with everything concerning big burrito , soba is excellent in all departments .
the space is elegant - - a waterfall <UNK> the interior .
lighting is dark as is the decor - - as with most big burrito establishments .
dishes are inventive - lrb - not your normal asian fusion dishes here - rrb - and well presented .
the quality of the ingredients is top-notch - lrb - my tuna tar <UNK> tasted very fresh - rrb - .
as a note , tasting menus are not available - - two specials seemed to offered every night .
the service is excellent , as is to be expected .
its just sliced sausage , with garlic - lrb - raw - rrb - .
be prepared for the fire , but this is an excellent dish .
the service is not perfect , but better than you should expect from most asian establishments .
this place is new american at its best - lrb - in pittsburgh - rrb - .
it did not beat my experience with the pork porterhouse just a few nights prior though .
the wine selection is extensive , as should be expected .
regardless , this is about the best dining experience in pittsburgh .
i say this as someone who is very much a gringo .
* the men ' s room could use some attention .
the <UNK> <UNK> the urinals to the walls has begun to peel and the porcelain itself is <UNK> .
being quick is great , but even applebee ' s is n't that quick and they just microwave things .
it is what it is , and the food is tasty enough .
i ' ll be back , ' cause i do n't have an ounce of regret .
they served me the biggest chicken thigh and drumstick that i have ever seen .
i got a couple of steak tacos to go which i had later at work .
the sauce in the cups that were packaged with was a highlight .
the sushi area seemed sanitary , and two guys were making the rolls fresh as i browsed .
so i stopped in here after work with a few co-workers .
i tried two beers and sampled a bit of a third .
<UNK> nova , <UNK> brown ale , and a bit of their pilot <UNK> autumn ale .
i tried the <UNK> on the suggestion of one of the people i was here with .
i ' d recommend this to someone who says they do n't like beer .
the <UNK> was given to us in a pitcher by another party that was leaving .
i had n't been to pedro ' s in years , since i lived in the area .
it was never one of my favorite places in madison , but i did enjoy it occasionally .
i ' m generally underwhelmed by the americanized mexican places that dot maps of most towns .
i had the asada burrito , and my dad had the chili burrito .
all in all , if you know what you ' re in for it ' s very standard <UNK> fare .
it arrived about 00 minutes later without any major issues there .
when i opened up the pizza , it looked promising .
both <UNK> swill and more local stuff like new <UNK> or wisconsin brewing co . .
the dã © cor is just as tacky as i remember .
it didnt get soggy until the very end when it was mostly just kraut and dressing left .
they use crushed ice and a shot of <UNK> to mix it .
- my fiancã © e got the mushroom and swiss burger , and her patty was burned .
my only real complaint about <UNK> is that it ' s not an international airport .
to say it ' s among the best in madison would be an understatement .
i can say that after one trip if they ' re at all consistent .
although i ' m in madison a lot , i only recently got a chance to check it out .
a five star greenhouse with a couple of issues that turn it into a three star greenhouse .
the prices are on the higher end of reasonable for most things .
indian restaurants seem to either be very formal or extremely casual .
that was definitely my first impression , so be prepared .
i figured something more basic would give me a gauge to work from if and when i return .
i ' ve been coming here since before they changed locations .
it ' s been consistent , it ' s been good .
here , though , their normal slices are painfully underrated in favor of their mac and cheese pizza .
the mac and cheese pizza is overrated , guys , it ' s tired .
the sausage with cheese is where it ' s at .
do n't get me wrong , their more eclectic offerings are always tasty .
- rrb - , the brisket and tots pizza is another fantastic option .
take your kid to work day used to be interesting .
i will admit , this place has been a bit of a <UNK> at times .
on that note , i ' ll also admit that i ' ve only ever tried their gyro .
the texture and flavor of <UNK> ' s meat succeeds where other gyro places fail .
the dã © cor is n't anything fancy , but since the remodel it seems pretty nice .
- lrb - this place used to look like a dump , not so much anymore .
- rrb - the roof garden upstairs provides a nice enough view of state street and the state capitol .
if you ' re not a fan of that scene i would avoid the <UNK> at night .
if you are , the gyros are even better when you ' re drunk .
oh , what the hell , this is madison ' s retro gaming mecca .
there ' s classic advertisements for old systems and just tons of cool stuff everywhere .
the same guy who runs the store is in there every time i ' ve been in .
this place is actually a pretty good diner , which is surprising considering its a truck stop .
i ' ve had messed up orders at the one in johnson creek , but never here .
the prices are extremely low compared to a lot of places around madison , as well .
a five star state capitol , snake infestation or not .
once you ' re in there is just a ton of stuff to see and do .
surprisingly , the place almost never seems dirty , even near the end of a game .
best sauce , best ribs , best this , best that .
you do n't get the awards this place has without knowing what you ' re doing .
i ' m also big fan of the bbq baked beans .
service is also always friendly and quick , especially considering how big the restaurant is .
i ' ve been coming to glass nickel for years on and off .
they also have a cash discount which is pretty cool .
it is obvious that the staff is not trained and not well managed .
the sausage is the sliced type rather than the meatball type and it was really good .
large was actually large and pretty cheap at $ 00 for a 00 ' ' !
really good quality food on par with the best indian restaurants in this region .
simple menus and the convenience of a world food market while you wait !
it was a little difficult to find but worth looking far .
i ' ve stayed with them as service is a few ticks more important than price .
i paid $ 0000 installed for a roof top unit .
i have to carry on sentiments from others over the years .
there is more to the story but i ' ll keep in brief .
walked in to a very warm greeting even though it was ten minutes to closing .
my wife and i got down to rita ' s to see what the <UNK> was about .
my wife had watermelon which btw was hand made with real pieces of watermelon , nice .
how does one make ` ` ice ' ' smooth ?
just a fair warning to anyone buying a certified <UNK> bmw .
they ' d do anything to sell ya a car .
that ' s my nearly $ 00k moral of the story .
it has been over five weeks and no refund has arrived .
i ca n't judge your staff with negativity as they really are doing the best they can .
mexican spice latte has left my tastebuds in a state of pure ecstasy .
0,000 sq ft <UNK> home loaded in 0â 0/0 hours .
you get a down to earth crew , including some great banter and a crazy russian !
` ` i dunno , it ' s all pretty good food .
' ' not obtaining help from him , i was left to choose what i thought was best .
not close to top 00 , but not bottom of the 00 .
they went above and beyond my expectations on making the system right for me .
they even pick up my pool toys after my daughter does n't !
i walked into <UNK> on the recommendation of a friend to see jason murphy .
yeah , i was that guy with a few ` ` <UNK> ' ' ideas on my arm and shoulder .
i have a feeling there will be more to come .
i ' ve had burritos , tacos , quesadillas , and much more and it ' s all fantastic .
00 minutes later a doctor still has not come in .
it ' s about time to scale back the number of clients and / or appointments you take .
one of the best spots to grab a meal after a long night of partying in vegas .
from one experience they did n't have prime rib for two straight nights .
for those that want to go cheap , they always have the $ 0.00 steak and eggs .
service here can be slow even though it may not be that crowded .
shack stack - combination with the <UNK> and shroom burger .
perfect combination of a beef patty and fried cheese stuffed mushroom together in a burger .
it ' s the one highlight i always remember back when i was in ny .
the fries are good itself but top it off with cheese ... <UNK> .
00 + minutes for sliders and the bartender asks if i want another drink and the .
customer service made it easy to get <UNK> on a weekend .
always well kept and clean during the 00 ' s games .
service calls relatively quick considering the amount of customers they are dealing with .
recently introduced signs discourage <UNK> from price condition / checking volumes .
wish their prices were accurate to market value as my collection would be notably more valuable .
three volumes i checked were in a range of 00 % - 000 % over market value .
no good if you know what you ' re doing anyway .
they should not be allowed to work on your car except to do oil changes and change tires .
they did the work with upgraded parts for $ 000 .
after another garage spent six days unsuccessfully determining the problem with my vehicle i had it towed here .
if you need work done on your vehicle , take it here you wo n't be dissappointed .
i ' ve enjoyed sushi all over the country from new york to san francisco .
if you go here you got ta try the vampire ! ! !
given their built in sports crowd it would seem they could n't care less about customer satisfaction .
it ' s like a five-star restaurant ' s chef opened up a strip-mall cafe .
these guys could have their own cooking show - or at least win all the contests .
two of my companions at stake which they both said were excellent .
this is the fifth time i ' ve been to this restaurant and it has been excellent every time .
and the atmosphere was good , and staff seem to be trying hard .
we are going to oc county fair in july just to see purple reign
we usually have great luck with best <UNK> but this was the pits .
it ' s in a seedy area around a lot of auto repair shops , no restaurants nearby .
i would recommend <UNK> to anyone looking for a great mexican food joint .
the portion they gave us was enormous , you can order one order for two normal size people .
oh yeah , they have different cheese for each kind of mac .
they ' re not as popular because of the location and the area near here is n't developed yet .
lol my friends and i went there for lunch ayce , it was like $ 00 including tax .
i do have to warn you on the 000 , we are not kidding .
they straight up use ghost peppers for it because i know what ghost peppers taste like .
my favorite thing on there is their kim chi fried rice , i get it with spam .
i definitely recommend the fried rice and nachos if you do get anything .
on the other hand , the food was very delicious .
the shake is great , the burger is <UNK> but it ' s like <UNK> good .
the only problem that i may see people having problem with is the slowness .
the food is awesome , i always get the tonkatsu <UNK> which has the chicken and port broth .
my friend and i always share the a big pork belly bowl as well .
the sides were amazing , their potato salad had so much mayo in it , it ' s ridiculous .
i mean the ribs were nice and tender which went really well with the <UNK> .
i was eating that and the short ribs the whole night .
normal price is $ 00.00 i believe but it ' s still cheap .
getting my full synthetic oil change and it ' s literally the cheapest in town .
it took them another 00 mins to get my orders right .
what a big difference than what i had last time .
i ' d like to say thank you to <UNK> , if you are reading this .
ordered two beers and she got them for us like right away .
the meat is great , the <UNK> is a little sweet but americans would love them .
the salad is great , a little salty but still good .
i had to order brisket and beef tongue like 0 times before i got them .
if they were busy i would understand but no one was there .
food quality wise , it ' s very good and delicious .
i do it according to the service that was provided but the service was pretty bad .
if you want service and do n't want to cook your own food , i say pass .
nice area to sit in , they have a really cool table that you can sit in .
i do n't see myself coming here a lot but it ' s worth trying .
i definition recommend everyone to come here and give it a try .
service can be a bit faster but it ' s well worth it .
they ' re very stingy with their minced pork rice lol but again it ' s still good .
my nephew had a kids meal , pull pork sandwich .
devil ' s spit mix with the mustard one is really good .
they were so help full and informative with products and at check out .
if i ' m correct , it was <UNK> and anna who helped .
thanks for the great service so i will definitely return to buy more stuff with my friends .
it was very expensive for what you got to be honest .
haha our server , mike , was really friendly and helpful .
the only thing that i think would be a concern for some people is the loud noise .
but then again people only come here for the loudness .
it ' s my favorite thing from there after the premium steak .
the sales experience was about as good as it gets with cars !
can not go past the jambalaya and the blackened catfish sandwich .
keep promising myself to leave these favs behind but can not do it !
if your a desert fan you have to try the new sweet potato pancakes .
i had one of their burgers while my wife had the roast beef au jus .
i would say the food was a bit better than average .
my wife and i had lunch at sonoma grille a few weeks ago when we were visiting pittsburgh .
my wife had the bahn mi which is a korean bbq .
wife and i love staying at the westin when we are town for sporting events .
convenient to everything in town and a short walk over the <UNK> bridge to the stadiums .
you do have the option to switch to the regular shower head with the twist of the hand .
the elevators do have a <UNK> system that tells you which elevator to use .
great stadium and great place to watch a game and have a fantastic view of the city .
$ 00 buys you 0 hot dogs and a bottle of water .
panera is much different ... staff has become mundane and impersonal .
the cookies are overpriced and missing my personal favorite peanut butter chocolate chip .
the price is pretty reasonable as well , seeing as how it ' s on the strip .
so knowing that , i brought a good amount of small bills with me to tip the valet .
i reserved the cheapest room available , and usually at other places it means no view .
it has free wifi included in the resort fees , enough for me to be happy .
do n't get me wrong , it is tasty but average .
you just ca n't get this kind of service at a big box store .
i then signed and returned with a 00 % down payment .
two weeks later , as promised , i got a call that my order was ready for pickup .
' ' legally speaking , she ' s right of <UNK> speaking , her logic is ridiculous .
the clowns did a fantastic job of providing transitions as the main performers prepared .
if your looking for a great pizza place in las vegas this is the place .
i definitely recommend this place and will be back for renewal next year !
dr . <UNK> was very affable and professional as well !
over all this place sucks , sorry to say , but its true .
definitely a place you have to try if you have not all ready .
i had the steak and mushroom pie it was savory with good favors .
they have great staff and service , great rates , great location ... plus free parking .
this place has an incredible selection of deli options all at pretty , darn competitive prices .
from pastas to spices to sauces to condiments - you name it , they got it !
highly recommend this spot ... great vibe , great people , great ingredients !
good bar for a lively crowd and a decent beer selection .
friendly service and very accommodating ... just wish they offered a beer special or two .
the location and pure ambience of this place are truly spectacular .
all that aside , the food is just really good ... not great or over-the-top in any way .
the service is fine , as well ... again , nothing to brag about - just solid .
' ' it surprises me that this guy has an entire museum for himself .
for my money , there are better museums in pittsburgh .
great ` ` hole in the wall ' ' spot serving middle east cuisine in a comfortable atmosphere .
all this combined with reasonable prices makes ali baba a great find .
this place is pretty darn good thai food at more than reasonable prices for downtown dining .
with super-friendly service , too - this place is a force to be <UNK> with .
the whole , delicious beast in all of its entirety .
came with a business party of about twelve and the place accommodated us just fine and without hesitation .
it offers relatively confined indoor seating or a charming , <UNK> patio right next to the place .
great stadium in arguably the best setting for a ballpark anywhere in the us or canada .
it combines the nostalgia of an old park with the modern amenities any fan would want .
put that combo together with great fans and you ' ve got a winner !
while i ' m not a pirates fan ... i ' m a big fan of pnc park !
not sure if i ' ll go back as there are certainly other options in the neighborhood .
couple that with stellar service and this restaurant is a force to be <UNK> with .
one 0 vapor is a new shop that i had not noticed before .
family owned / <UNK> and shows in menu and service .
queen creek is now the place for great stuffed pizza .
must give 00 min to cook the deep dish pizzas to order ... but worth the wait !
owners and staff make you feel at home ... even if you ' re not from chi town .
probably one the best chinese food restaurants this side of town .
reasonably priced for the quality , taste and large menu portions served .
something to consider - no matter how great the vehicle .
if they dont back the car ' s workmanship / reliability ... why buy ?
food always seems over salty with no flavor - but fresh .
dealer does offer great service deals with coupons that come up from time to time .
subaru dealership in phoenix off central is the best in town .
high quality work for prices - even if a little bit of a drive away .
other than that , probably been here 00 times and its typical decent bar food .
bartenders are good , can be a bit slow sometimes but cant we all .
had a few different things over numerous trips but the greek cheesesteak is where its at !
0 stars for the modern went here for a co-workers bday , will be a <UNK> !
basically a chicken pot pie , with the crust just being on the top , nice and flaky .
i got the texas ave and the pittsburgh dog , both were pretty good .
but as a one man shop , i completely understand .
got the ravioli and chicken special at the waitresses recommendation and it was unreal .
quality pizza and hoagies , buffalo chicken pizza and hoagie are both really good .
my wife wanted something done and we got a recommendation from friends about <UNK> laser center .
it did n't seem as if one scene was related to the next .
my recommendation is the zumanity show ... well worth the money .
what started out as just a convenient stop with friends has now turned into a great pleasure .
the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is also enjoyable .
the quality of all of the different types of meat were amazing .
i tried this place because it had good reviews on yelp .
<UNK> is quite possibly the most disrespectful person i have ever dealt with .
not to mention that they raised our rent without any notice .
if the wife likes wine and the hubby likes a cold one , perfect !
first off let me start by saying that i was in the mortgage industry for about 0 years .
especially the emotional roller coaster it is getting a home loan .
to not drag this review on too long , i will briefly give you some of the details .
i provided <UNK> the details of the loan and i was under a time crunch .
i had 00 days to close with probably no possibility to get the contract extended .
<UNK> has the knowledge and experience to know what the <UNK> will want for each loan .
she helped a ton at the end along with the rest of <UNK> ' s team .
they hit all the dates that needed to be hit .
if you can get qualified for a loan they will get the job done !
you receive a phone call and email for a reminder so your service is never missed .
we live right down the road and frequent the place often .
it did get a bit busy and i understand that as i am in the restaurant business .
quantity is big , price is low and taste is spot on .
just a normal gay bar with good prices and good people .
the clientele is more mature than many of the gay bars .
any of the reviews that talk about service are ridiculous .
the creepy mickey mouse and donald duck paintings are <UNK> .
not my # 0 choice of gay bar in phoenix , but on the list .
and i ' m not talking about a few dollars too expensive .
for an average dinner , you ' ll be spending $ 00 to $ 00 .
i had no idea what kind of egg it would be ... hard boiled ?
this is a dinning experience , more than it ' s about the actual food .
and he let us know what he would be ordering if given the chance .
if you ' re searching for some good mexican food , you should visit del <UNK> .
the food is pretty affordable , and it tastes great .
they have a minimum credit card charge , which is around $ 0 .
most of us ate from their weekday lunch special - lrb - about $ 0 per plate - rrb - .
the lunch special comes with soup and an egg roll .
there are a few thai places in this area , and tottie ' s is one of the better .
the two of us ordered one pizza - lrb - shared - rrb - and two sodas .
do n't go to boston ' s to karaoke alone or with just one or two people .
there was one guy at the bar that was friends with the employees .
the prices were a bit high for what we ate .
i had a pita sandwich and it was just under $ 00 .
if you ' re in the mood for a real cheesesteak , this place is right for you .
the cook helped me narrow down my options when i asked what i would enjoy .
the cashier said , ` ` good choice ; the pizza cheesesteak is great !
i ' ve eaten lunch and breakfast here , and prefer their breakfast menu .
go here if you want greasy hangover food that will fill you up for cheap .
i ate the tacos de carne ... and they were great .
any of the negative reviews here were about price and portions .
i got the ice cream with a small pastry type of food and it was great .
also got a discount on a filter and a mail in rebate for the oil chance .
new to the area and found this place on yelp .
the dough and crust was some of the best i ' ve ever had on a pizza .
tasty and thick unlike a lot of places now days .
both the ranch and marinara come in a big container .
i chose to get ` ` the works ' ' staff was professional and courteous .
the rags they use should be thrown out or not used as often .
my truck had residue left over from the rags everywhere .
i suggest asking them to use new or fresh rags .
flavor all the way down in the meat not just on the outside like some places .
that ' s generally not what i expect when i go to a place like that .
i tried all the meats and they were definitely good .
i favored the chicken and tofu over the beef but it was still good .
the world needs more bars / dining places like this .
the employees are very nice and the boba is very good .
i ' m a little late on my review , but better late than never .
dinner buffet ... horrid ! ! ! only thing that was descent about this buffet was the soda .
and ... in the end they were able to make it on time .
and ... in the end they were able to make it on time .
visited charlotte for 00 hours of booty and was recommended by a friend to go here .
if you are visiting charlotte , make this one of your stops .
very poor management , and very <UNK> rules pretty good spot .
having the <UNK> all in one spot is what brought us there , and did not disappoint .
great place to stop off and enjoy a chicken burro enchilada style !
built in the 00s it was recently <UNK> as a doubletree .
nothing jumps out that rates it a hilton level property .
bathrooms are as small as they were in the 00s .
dr . <UNK> is very professional and very courteous to my two teenage kids .
he <UNK> very well with them and makes them feel very comfortable .
sit at the bar , the sushi chefs are very entertaining .
had the hell ' s fire burger , sweet potato fries , wings for appetizer and a chocolate shake .
this is still one of the best places to eat in vegas .
the only positive is that the food was pretty good .
read the reviews and thought we give it a try .
not a 0 star cause that would be a wow , but will be back for sure .
i got the country fried steak with mash potatoes and macaroni .
had the alligator bits for appetizer and that was the only thing i was a little dissatisfied with .
finished off with a slice of peanut butter pie which tasted amazing .
the only thing this restaurant has in its favor is the ambiance .
i was amazed that such a beautiful resort would have such inferior food and service .
if you have had pizza in italy , you ' ll see the same quality here at this restaurant .
it is rarely full with patrons and that should be a red flag .
they microwaved the potatoe pancake and it naturally transformed to rubber .
the remaining order was returned as cold as it was the first time around .
food in the restaurant is inconsistent and the servers are the same .
front desk staff ranges from competent and friendly to incompetent and unfriendly .
shortage of staff seems apparent in the overall upkeep of this place in all departments .
they really need to invest some money into this resort to give it some life .
it is just an ` ` ok ' ' place .
the food is consistently well prepared and the service is excellent .
based on many visits , i would highly recommend this restaurant .
i would highly recommend this dealership , especially the service department .
the service manager , keith is a true professional who cares about the customer .
a family member was treated here and my experiences were all quite positive .
i ' d give it 00 stars ! ! great restaurant .
competition would be a good thing for them and the consumer .
the customer should not have to observe or hear their comments when assignment overload occurs .
they have yet to figure out how to put all the charges on one sheet .
just when you think you ' ve paid all the charges , more are mailed out separately .
. in summary , this place has built up an image from its past .
i do n't think scottsdale people will in the long run tolerate this substandard establishment .
my compact car never ran through on their tracks smoothly .
their equipment popped off my <UNK> and was subsequently damaged with a large crack running through it .
it is a relatively new car and in great condition .
plenty of other car wash places to do business with .
regardless it ' s a great show and worth seeing .
his name was larry and he was basically <UNK> everybody that was waiting to get a car .
he did n't even try to sound like michael cuz he had a latin accent !
had one bad experience but overall i like this place .
it ' s the same as every other bww i have been to .
service can be sketchy during games but that is expected when it ' s packed .
if they do n't have the part usually i can pick it up at el mirage .
always able to explain and fix any problems that i have .
service is top notch & usually most checkout lanes are open during busy times .
not bad for it being next to a gas station !
i ' m sorry but this sonic is n't even worth reviewing about .
big surprise was wings are the biggest and best i ' ve had around .
if you like authentic ny pizza , this place reminds me of home .
mr . <UNK> , by chance one day talked about making pizza .
it comes as no surprise that they have been recognized as the # 0 pizza place in phoenix ! !
i work within walking distance of mr . chop chop , so i often drop by for lunch .
i took my girlfriend here with some friends to help celebrate her birthday .
she ' s from new orleans and knows quality nola food .
` ` hey , let ' s all get pizza !
' ' the addition of pop up pizza to the plaza hotel helps avoid such <UNK> .
try something different every time , but always get a order of eel <UNK> tempura rolls .
speaking of which , books or books has a very fair trade policy .
fine , fine independent shop in a world dominated by chains .
took my new <UNK> girlfriend here after an unsatisfactory dinner at lola ' s .
still looking for quality new orleans cuisine and good service under one roof .
best late night asian dining in vegas , for sure .
the pho and other traditional vietnamese food is great , but surprisingly their orange chicken is also fantastic .
cheesesteaks and milk shakes are completely out of the picture .
dave and the gang are always very friendly , as well .
excellent chicken and waffles just as advertised but forced valet parking is stupid .
i called autozone and can by a fuel pump for 000.00 .
if you have money to blow go here they will take your money for sure .
the hot wings are <UNK> bad , the atmosphere is boring / uninspired , and the beer is over priced .
i ' ve used task master carpet cleaning for years and i ' ve always been more than satisfied .
there is seating available but it ' s not a <UNK> joint .
this place seems to get a lot of <UNK> hype .
... basically just means same quality as standard bar food but a higher price .
i had a regular filet with a side of peppercorn sauce and another side of the creamed corn .
the sides of the mashed potatoes 0 ways was stunning .
the creamed corn with jalapeno was very good , although not the best ever .
i ' m a fan of strip steak for sure .
since i ' m yelping everything else i went to in vegas , why not include sinatra ?
apparently steve wynn was buddies with old blue eyes , hence the name of the place .
after 00 minutes i knew this was n't part of the act .
by the 00 minute mark people were getting up and walking out .
unfortunately , my mood had been a little soured by the interruption .
the rest of the show was pretty much as the other reviews have described .
i had a very friendly waiter named david who was quite helpful .
nice , most waiters would have simply <UNK> down the order and ran to the kitchen .
i had a filet with a side of peppercorn sauce and the au gratin potatoes .
i had several bits of the steak without the peppercorn sauce to verify the taste of the beef .
it was very nice , although it could have had slightly more <UNK> to it .
as for the au gratin potatoes , they are pure heart stopping bliss in a nice hot dish .
cheesy , gooey , <UNK> , <UNK> heaven in a bowl .
i am still on the quest though for the better steak .
it draws a slightly older crowd than what is usually found in clubs on the strip .
there is definitely a good selection of bourbon if that ' s your thing .
after a few manhattans i was feeling good and ready and the videos and music did not disappoint .
any fan of 00 ' s music should check this place out .
the wife and i recently went to celebrate our first anniversary .
review : best friggin ' tomato you ' ll ever eat .
review : like everything else , the portion served is tiny .
if i remember correctly this was a pretty damn good ravioli .
smoked and seared tuna , cauliflower , nori and green curry .
<UNK> : i asked at the beginning of the meal for the kobe beef .
' ' so , here they substituted the veal for the kobe beef i asked for .
soy beans cooked risotto style with lemon <UNK> and coriander .
a very small risotto that was nice after the heavier courses and was excellent .
even better though , the wife does n't like fruity desserts , so she sent hers back .
think of the meg ryan scene in ` ` when harry met sally .
if there were a ` ` zero stars ' ' rating , fairmont would have more than earned it .
since their latest foray into <UNK> here it has only become worse .
' ' 0 tips : 0 - rrb - you must order your burger poutine style .
i had : <UNK> potatoes , manly burger poutine style and <UNK> a mule and cucumber drink thing .
i ordered a large cold brew and it was just an iced drip brew .
easily the best pizza on the west side of town ... possibly the valley in general .
all i ordered was fries , and i got my food about ten minutes after everyone else did .
from what i gathered , this place is a madison landmark .
i think the folks giving this place one and two star reviews need to lighten up .
note : i am only giving this franchise establishment three stars as a rule i have for chains .
i ' m from the dallas area and had never heard of topper ' s until a trip to madison .
after spending the night getting hammered downtown until 0:00 a . m . , i was in need of sustenance .
i was staying at a hotel in sun prairie and everything there shuts down at 00 .
ihop - lrb - e . washington location - rrb - was packed and mcdonald ' s did n't really sound appealing .
saw that topper ' s is open until 0 and i figured ` ` what the hell ' ' .
i ordered a large 0 topping pizza special that included an order of <UNK> .
i get back to my hotel room and dive into a damn good pie .
i will be back the next time i ' m in madison .
0 pool tables and a dart board with decent tvs .
maybe , i ' ll give it a try during dinner time but i doubt it .
been to this place a bunch of times , good prices , good food , and quick .
the wings have multiple sauce options and are always cooked perfectly , absolutely a must try .
the next morning i pick the cinnamon and toast it .
but with the high expectation i can only rate it a 0 star .
the main course , was of coarse , the steak and fries .
the steak was very low grade , tough and not a lot of flavor .
service was ok , not bad but nothing special either .
the food here is way below average and the price is way too much for what it is .
so to compensate they give you two types of exotic dipping sauces to choose from .
sadly i predict this place will soon be out of business .
it ' s pretty simple , when we go to las vegas we stay at the mandalay bay .
a couple recommendations on places to eat when you come are as follows .
charlie <UNK> steakhouse which is technically at the four seasons but it ' s right downstairs .
0th time in vegas , 0th time at the mandalay in a word , amazing .
pretty much a <UNK> for the single best show i have ever seen in my life .
emotional and touching , with each scene upping the ante from the previous one .
seriously , book it now and do n't second guess it , we were completely blown away .
first i was put into a grand king when i reserved a one bed room suite .
got walked in on by another guest assigned to the same room .
the nachos were among the best i have ever had .
the pizza was nothing compared to new haven pizza , but was thin crust and hit the spot .
from sandwiches to desserts once you go , you ' ll keep going back .
this place used to be great to go to before driving home from las vegas to los angeles .
my friend and brother who only authorized the basic massaged appeared to <UNK> her .
the scalp massage was abrasive for my brother and i .
that was why i paid you the hourly rate for .
this place is shady and i recommend going somewhere else .
that said , it is still a part of the old las vegas that is near <UNK> .
it saddens me to see this place go downhill from what it once was .
it used to be amazing quality here but they raised the prices and lowered the quality .
it ' s truly amazing this fine restaurant <UNK> in the middle of chaos at circus circus .
this is like a diamond in the rough or like an island .
my wife had the chicken oriental salad which is a favorite of hers .
when i told the front desk , they were indifferent and told me they would change the sheets .
skip this poor excuse for a hotel and stay at an establishment that cares about their customers .
the people who work at the counter / bar absolutely despise their jobs .
keeping these bad apples around is going to create a toxic environment for both your employees and customers .
the counter / bar staff are still as inattentive and bitter as ever .
this is without a doubt the worst dining establishment i ' ve ever encountered .
the french onion soup and lamb / beef burgers are fantastic .
i received my first traffic ticket a few months ago .
speed trap on reno st . caught me doing 00mph in a 00 zone .
this means no insurance premium boost , no points , no traffic school .
i live at the mgm signature and eat here most weekdays .
i ' ve been here well over 000 times for both lunch and dinner .
counter server <UNK> provides excellent service , and manager carrie keeps this place running like a <UNK> <UNK> .
overall , great food , great service , excellent value !
i ' m surprised by the negative reviews i ' m seeing here .
i ' ve never been to this store in person but called them today from fedex at the mgm .
i was in a bit of a pickle - lrb - that ' s just an expression - rrb - .
i ' m a strip local and this is one of my favorite mexican joints .
only downside is that unlike most mexican joints , they charge for chips and salsa .
- lrb - 0 - rrb - getting gas after the carwash might seem convenient but i would n't recommend it .
the gas station attracts bums who ask customers for money while they ' re pumping .
this place is a-ok and i ' ll be back .
a crucial factor in my decision to live at the mgm signature is the las vegas monorail .
it gets me up and down the strip in no time .
the monorail is consistently clean , well maintained , and on schedule .
the customer service employees and security personnel are friendly , competent , and helpful .
the answer will always be the same : purchasing tickets is a major hassle .
sometimes the tickets simply ca n't be purchased because the line is too long .
sometimes there are plenty of tickets but the dispenser is jammed or just does n't work properly .
the frustrating thing is , most of these operational problems could be resolved quite easily .
the obvious question is : why are regular riders forced to use paper ` ` tickets ' ' at all ?
they do an excellent job if you can actually get them to service your vehicle .
i stopped by this place a few days ago and asked for an exterior wash .
the employee said something to the effect of , ` ` i ' ve got to warn you .
it ' s going to take a long time , at least twenty minutes .
you ' re going to have to get in that line .
' ' the ` line ' consisted of one vehicle .
' ' there were a total of three customers present .
but let ' s just say the sls is underwhelming .
you can probably skip this place on your next vegas trip .
they had a pancake griddle in there with a line of senior citizens out the door .
felt like i was in <UNK> , mo . or something .
i was tempted to give him a ` ` what ` choo ' talking ' ` bout , <UNK> ?
here are the things you need to know : rent : always rent directly from the apartment owner .
a fair price for a fully furnished one bedroom - lrb - as opposed to a studio jr . .
suite - rrb - unit on an upper floor is $ 0,000 / month with a one year lease .
rent typically includes water , trash , electricity , and cable but this is <UNK> with the owner .
cable / internet / phone : cable is supposed to be included but the service is worthless .
internet is supposed to be included but it ' s worthless .
for $ 000 / mo , you ' ll get <UNK> internet , cable , dvr , and phone service .
it will take me years to explore all the great eateries within walking distance .
technically it ' s free but i give them a $ 0 tip when they bring me my car .
suite ' ' - lrb - i . e . studio - rrb - near the elevator , you ' re going to get major noise .
it ' s small but has adequate cardio equipment , weight machines , and free weights .
avoid those hours and you ' ll have no problem .
let ' s say you live on the twenty fifth floor in unit 000 .
washer / dryer : the ` ` green ' ' washer and dryers built into each unit are effectively useless .
there ' s a secure laundry facility downstairs with plenty of ` ` real ' ' washer / dryers that work just fine .
they charge a ` ` reservation fee ' ' each time .
be sure to throw the <UNK> on your hotel door whenever you ' re in the room .
a hotel employee entered the man ' s room at 00pm for unknown reasons .
i finished my coffee and 0/0 of the cup full with ice .
for food quality to dollar value , it ' s hard to do better than this place .
- lrb - especially if i ' ve had a tough day at the craps tables .
awsome club ! ! ! great environment , they really decorated the place .
then top floor area to hang out and some dancing which was nice .
all of the patrons were well taken care of by the service staff .
the bar area was typical of a high priced , restaurant ' s bar .
i had a glass of south american cabernet and my date had the <UNK> cup .
i may go back to try other things as they have some good looking desserts .
the best cheap chinese food in pittsburgh , hands down .
their menu is typical of any cheap chinese food joint .
general tso ' s chicken , chicken and broccoli , szechuan , and other chinese food regulars are here .
located in bloomfield , it ' s certainly in a prime location .
it has a quiet atmosphere other than hearing whatever the employees are talking about .
overall , this is my favorite chinese food in the the ` burgh .
they are even willing to deliver out to <UNK> sometimes which is an added bonus .
the singers were great and seemed to sound better the longer the show went on .
this place is very clean which is something i notice every time i go there .
the staff are friendly and engaging which makes the experience even better .
they offer several flavors that also range in there sugar content .
seated within the mirage on the strip , kokomo ' s is definitely an impressive , fine-dining experience .
we also had washington apple martinis as that was the drink on special .
one thing that this place is great for is getting you out of there quickly !
i choose aiello ' s , though mineo ' s is pretty damn good too .
i ' ve never had a better local pizza in pittsburgh .
there ' s specialty pizzas , pizza by the slice , hoagies , desserts , salads and other items .
this place is no different than any other ` burger bar ' type of restaurant .
lot ' s of crazy burger choices and they ' re pretty tasty .
i can get the same experience here in pittsburgh by going to brgr or burgatory .
link to there website : http://url it does still satisfy the taste buds though .
<UNK> is somewhere i ' ve been multiple times , especially in the summertime .
very tasty , made right in front of you with natural ingredients .
if you work downtown please go there for a cheap , delicious lunch .
i first went there last winter at the suggestion of a friend .
these are not authentic , mexican tacos so do n't go there thinking that .
the burgers are $ 0 and the sides are typically $ 0 .
i got the steak burger very pink and it was delicious .
i will be going back again soon as it was pretty good for a food truck .
there ' s nothing and i mean nothing fancy about the dining area .
feel free to give me suggestions but its going to be hard to top this place .
it was $ 0 and some change and boy was this thing enormous !
i surely ate the whole thing too as i was starving .
the guy at the register was very friendly and the staff was nice as a whole .
they cook the meat right in front of you instead of <UNK> it .
so i was never a consistent coffee drinker until i started working in the 000 grant street building .
- lrb - sometimes , they do n't even charge me for the shot - rrb - .
the selection of coffee there is typical of any coffee joint .
- lrb - if you ' re not on a diet - rrb - .
i ' m always a fan of a locally owned place , especially a whiskey place .
every drink that i had was delicious and it helps that the owners are very friendly and attentive .
i went here to watch the pitt panthers bowl game this past weekend .
it looks very fancy , typical of a restaurant in a casino .
the wine selection is varied enough to satisfy your curious palate .
took my girlfriend there for a little date night this past friday .
i ordered the street noodle # 0 and my girlfriend had the pad thai .
while dining , we sampled their italian perogies , gumbo , french onion soup , and buffalo steak .
in summary , this is a good microbrew and restaurant in an extremely creative atmosphere .
we stopped here expecting them to have raw bar options as their name would imply .
their drink selection is simple with many local brews and mass produced american beers .
this bar has a nice decor honoring the steelers and their great jerome <UNK> .
when outdoors or near the rear of the restaurant you can enjoy a view of pittsburgh ' s rivers .
one interesting item is the ` ` <UNK> ' ' window in the men ' s restroom .
when taking a leak , the urinals double as an observation deck for the bar .
most likely one of the best places in pittsburgh if you like an extremely large vodka mixer .
for the beer lover , they have a selection of 0 beers on tap .
however , their extensive selection of microbrews is one of the best in town .
this is a smoking establishment that has one long bar that runs the length of the business .
this is a cool place to stop on the north shore .
this was an excellent place to stop for some drinks after a ball game at pnc .
in addition , they have some props in the bar that make for some good photo opportunities .
drink selection is typically from local breweries with larger scale production or from america ' s mass production breweries .
i doubt that there are any drinks that are n't good on the menu .
they have 0 beers on tap and a decent selection of bottles .
our bartender bianca was fantastic and served us several times during our stay at fairmont .
the decor includes props from the steel era in pittsburgh , and a nice stone and wood interior .
the interior of the bar and restaurant are opened to the outdoor air on nice days .
' ' a margarita with a beer of your choice poured inside .
based on the size of the pie , it should have taken a lot less .
however , as a dive bar , casey ' s is one of the better ones in town .
you should come here expecting cheap drinks by any other bars standards on carson street and outrageous specials .
while we were here , i enjoyed an ipa from their extensive selection of draft beers .
my girlfriend had a few of their special $ 0 margaritas when we visited .
men should note that there are no ` ` number 0s ' ' in the restroom .
in addition to a cocktail menu , they also offer a reasonable selection of beers including microbrews .
this is an interesting little cigar & coffee shop , which is relatively rare .
we stopped here on a walk through the strip district to check it out and have a cigar .
from the outside , the location does n't seem extremely appealing .
however , they do have a rich selection and several top rated cigars to choose from .
my girlfriend and i explored this place while out on mount washington one night .
the service was good here with frequent visits from the wait staff .
this is probably the nicest hotel in the pittsburgh area .
in addition to their human staff , they also employ a canine greeter .
i was told some guests have had the opportunity to walk her while visiting the property .
on each floor , they have an ice machine and a filtered water machine .
the corned beef was ground beef - lrb - not corned - rrb - covered with fried potato strings .
cole slaw , thick potato fries , and the meat of your choice on fresh baked italian bread .
i frequently visit this primanti brothers location , and love the classic pittsburgh sandwiches they serve .
i wish i read the previous review before walking in here one night with my girlfriend .
this place is a rough one to hang out in .
this is a dive bar across the bridge from the stadium .
not the nicest place i ' ve ever been to , but not the worst .
if you order a draft beer here they come in 0 sizes .
large is enormous and the regular is close to a pint glass .
this is a nice bar and restaurant in pittsburgh ' s market square .
this is one of my favorite establishments to visit when in pittsburgh .
it is a perfect venue for people that want to sample micro brewed beers from around the country .
while here we ordered the fire and ice , asian , and <UNK> seviche .
the service was very good with frequent visits from the wait staff .
this is one of the better bars in the southside .
for their cocktails , their menu has several names based on the movies .
the bar is relatively small with a small dining area at the back of the business .
in addition , they have an upstairs where they have live music .
their bar menu is extremely interesting with one of the best slider selections you can find anywhere .
the hofbrauhaus is a must stop for anyone visiting pittsburgh .
this german beer hall serves beer by the liter at a reasonable price .
the live entertainment in the beer hall makes any evening here fun with friends .
in the <UNK> leagues , it provides one of the best feelings of community when watching the game .
and , it is built to highlight the beauty of downtown pittsburgh .
it does n't get much better than this for seafood and cocktails .
they have a good selection of beers and reasonable well drinks .
the <UNK> has an extensive amount of beer to try as the name would suggest .
they have a frequent diner punch card that will get you a free pizza after buying 0 .
this restaurant is part of jimmy d ' s bar .
my girlfriend and i frequent this bar when visiting pittsburgh .
it ' s location along the <UNK> river gives it a view of the water and the city .
in addition , they have an excellent beer selection both on tap and in bottles .
they have many seating options including couches , bar seating , tables , and outdoor .
rivers is a nice property for the people of pittsburgh to visit .
however , it is pretty plain in terms of many casinos i ' ve visited in the past .
its distance from its east coast competitors allow it to charge for beverages ordered on the floor .
they have all the amenities you would expect a few bars , a buffet , and some restaurants .
overall , there ' s nothing too amazing or excellent about this casino .
the set up is relatively nice , despite its small size .
they have some comfortable seating available and a bar that seats approximately 00 .
they had a reasonable beer offering , ok well drinks , & adequate service .
we did not eat during our visit , we arrived after the kitchen closed at 00:00 pm .
they had a reasonable selection of draft beer , including a couple for ipa lovers .
the clientele also offered some friendly conversation when sitting at the bar .
as a customer , one thing i love is being seen and they did a great job .
their kitchen is <UNK> to the bar at the very far end .
the bartenders were extra friendly and provided us with excellent service during our visit here .
i have been to chicago numerous times and thought that the sandwich and pizza were spot on .
portillo ' s is what i measure italian beef by and this was sooooo close .
i ordered a whole pie a couple of days later and it was equally fantastic .
i sure hope not because <UNK> needs a spot like this .
ive found the food to be very good here and the service to be above average .
what i do see are alot of ridiculous people eating there .
i think this is an above average restaurant with nice wine prices , good - lrb - and sometimes great !
i have eaten here on numerous occasions and have found it to be a little over-hyped .
i would rate their sandwiches as ` ` good ' ' not ` ` excellent ' ' .
what i have always found to be subpar is their bread .
i did rate it as good however and that ' s what you ' ll find here .
this process has been botched by no less than 0 of your employees .
i notify the seller and he then sells the car .
i have been a member of desert schools for at least 0 decades .
after all this a manager says to me , <UNK> sorry nothing we can do now .
kind of like a sicilian pie with alot less cheese .
i came here expecting great but the service was a bit off and the food just above average .
you can definitely tell they use lower grade steaks than the original mastro ' s .
. this is as good as it gets for this style of food in this town .
it ' s got a nice atmosphere and the owners are great people .
i cant wait to try everything else on their menu .
its not fine dining and your not paying fine dining prices so relax .
i dated a rican who ' s mother cooked all the traditional dishes .
for me it ' s all about the rice and beans though .
thankfully el <UNK> is right around the corner from my house and is as good as it is .
sat down and were immediately greeted and i ordered a beer .
i work in a restaurant and am very patient as i understand that sometimes shit happens .
at this point we look at each other and on cue both stand up and walk out .
started with the steak tartare which was really light and came with a really amazing potato chip / waffle fry .
i still am amazed that there are any bad reviews about this place .
the complaints are really obscure and hard to figure out .
know these things and you will be in for a great experience and some world class pizza .
. this is one of the best , most consistent restaurants in scottsdale .
there beef ribs are also the best that i have ever had .
they are meaty and tender and the barbecue sauce is out of this world .
the pulled pork sandwich with the spicy barbecue is the best i ' ve had in az . .
they call thier ribs the best in az and they might be right .
definitely up there with the best bbq in the phoenix area .
they are big on curries and have kind of a small menu .
ate here last night and the food and service was very good .
also had sides of brussels w / pancetta and a meatball in sauce and both were good .
other pluses were the beer list and the wine list as well as the retro <UNK> ambiance .
the manager attempted to push a detail service for what minimal effort took to remove road grime .
delicious ! ! excellent sushi and very good service and happy hour .
all and all the experience was horrible , and i do t recommend this to anyone .
this place puts any of those big name sandwich places to shame !
beer specials as expected and try the diablo chicken sandwich it was great !
i called this business to get an estimate on a garage opener repair .
he was very cordial and answered any questions i had along the way .
' ' came here with a friend not knowing what to expect .
the atmosphere is very chill and it was easy to find an area to suit your interests .
i had the jack daniel ' s bbq chicken and it was fantastic !
i ' ve enjoyed driving through this place many times but i wont be fooled again .
if you have n't been to a chipotle you should .
the staff has always been top notch and the food prepared exactly to specs .
the manager and employees all seem to enjoy their work and that always shows in a meal .
it was a burrito with french fries inside that was unique .
nothing outstanding but nice to mix it up if your tired of the average burrito .
this place is a staple of i - 00 , or arizona for that matter .
this is a definite must see and eat destination if you ' re new to the phoenix area !
the wait staff was courteous and professional and made us feel welcome .
no bells , whistles , slot machines or <UNK> bumping into you with their mega cups of beer .
if you want to gamble , aria is literally a 00 yards from the entrance of the mandarin .
for the vegas first timer , you probably want to stay at a hotel casino at least once .
for those that go there regularly , put the mandarin on your short list .
standard place that grew fast and has lots of spider <UNK> .
i have lived in las vegas for 0 + years now .
its one of the most amazing views of the strip anywhere in vegas .
its not gourmet , but their take on island food is decent .
eye candy is a great place to start a night out .
friday and saturday nights have an awesome dj , great crowd .
there is no line , bouncers or cover charge like most places in vegas .
too much comic sans font but a good <UNK> walker .
good coffee , strong oatmeal and raisin cookie and nice <UNK> chairs .
each piece of the smoke meat is a little piece of heaven .
the brisket has been smoked to perfection that it is super tender .
the line may be long , but the wait is absolutely worth it .
will def do business with them again in the future .
but for the price and the amenities i used , this place was great .
my wife loves the mud garden mule and i get the local beer that ' s on tap .
they only had wings , nothing else and it would be a 00min .
unparalleled topping choices , i definitely recommend it over other sandwich shops .
larry and brandy were incredibly helpful during my vacuum buying experience .
so its what you put into it is what you get out of it .
persian tv is playing to help with the authentic feel .
the grape leaves were well made and had a great flavor .
everything came together well , the pickled radishes was a nice touch .
presentation was straight forward and no frills , they let the food speak for itself so .
i recommend this place for good food with a homemade feel at a great price .
first bonus was that they had samuel adams <UNK> on tap and served nicely chilled .
i decided to try the flying <UNK> pizza and it was great .
i come from a korean and mexican background so this place was perfect for me .
another recommended item is the <UNK> bulgogi , spicy pork , french fries .
at 0.00 its more expensive then cici ' s but you get what you pay for ten times over .
came for an oil change and pulled into the ` ` quick lube ' ' stall which was empty .
heard about this place from a friend after it was on food network .
you would never see this place off the road unless you knew where it was .
its tucked into a residential <UNK> which adds to the <UNK> feel of the place .
the ribs were a little dry but the flavor was very good .
the rub was excellent and great smokey flavor , could have just been a bad day .
you get a great sausage flavor up front and then the heat follows up shortly .
first being easier access due to not being as packed as other gyms .
even during peak times you still do n't have to park on the other end of the world .
for those wanting more authentic korean food they offer a wide range of soups and rice dishes .
but beware , the staff is very unfriendly , and they charge for almost everything .
on my last night , i talked to a man at the front desk .
a woman was furious on the other end , stating we were 00 minutes late to checkout .
i tried to argue my case to no avail , chelsea was n't having it .
' ' after 0 weeks , 0 calls , and 0 emails , they finally responded .
the rooms and grounds are nice , but the staff is n't .
if you can find another room with the extra price cap , i would skip the blair house .
this was easily the worst restaurant experiences i ' ve had since moving to pittsburgh .
in general the menu looks overpriced considering the atmosphere and quality we experienced .
all in all the experience was so bad it was almost comical .
i ' ll be taking my business elsewhere from now on .
they have a great beer selection , wonderful bar food , solid service and are very reasonably priced .
i guess it just means we ' ll have to go back .
every beer i ' ve had here has been ice cold , and the service has been strong too .
it ' s a great place to watch a pirates game too .
if you are veg in vegas and want a buffet you really ca n't go wrong here .
the thing that is most impressive here is when i ask ` ` does this have meat in it ?
if the person behind the line does not know , they will find out for you .
i ' ll be back , as the owner promised i would .
low calorie lunch options that taste as good as they look .
portions are well balanced and we ' ll priced went in at 0pm and was seated right away .
. all you can eat at dinner is 00 bucks but sashimi is not part of it .
i like their pizza compared to other chains such as pizza hut and little caesars .
i like their sauce and they seem to be nice people .
orders are usually pretty quick - i tend to come here during <UNK> hour times though .
service is to be expected of a pho place because of its popularity .
if you are going north towards spring mountain , it is easy to access .
the palm course was in very poor condition for the money .
greens were poorly kept , one had a large brown / sandy area on side of green .
greens are hard and do not hold no matter what spin you put on the ball .
it tends to be very busy and it is important to get a reservation if you can .
the only issue i have with texas de brazil is that it cost about $ 00 / person .
thats ok , we will go to lotus of siam , and all will be good .
luckily the thai place in the same shopping center is all vegetarian and fantastic .
ok , this review has nothing to do with lotus of siam .
its all been said , but its worth saying again .
it feels like a restaurant that should be medium priced .
the prices are higher than your normal neighborhood hole in the wall .
coming from seattle , beer snob usa , i never have high expectations east of the mississippi .
really solid basics as well as <UNK> executed experimental beers .
top off the great beer with awesome service , sweet street seating , and a good crowd .
the tacos were fantastic and the margaritas were stiff and delicious .
the crowd of as hope , <UNK> , and fun .
we had to drive <UNK> blocks from the omni william penn hotel .
this will be our go to pizza joint when staying in downtown pittsburgh .
the cost was much cheaper then doing the wash and fold myself at a laundromat .
i ' ve never had bad meal , their lunch based on the menu looks very promising .
i recommend to my friends when ever they are looking for a good breakfast joint .
the terminal 0 security line is far far far slower than terminal 0 .
they have such a great selection if burgers that are all amazing .
sometimes the service is slow , but overall the experience is always great .
the service was fast but the food was very good .
i ' d suggest this restaurant to anyone who enjoys mongolian .
worst service ive ever seen for a nice classy place .
one of madison ' s best , most consistent least appreciated downtown bars .
$ 00 is way too much to spend on hamburger on a stale bun .
they used to make great fries here and now all they have is deep fried diced potatoes gross !
walk into the <UNK> stained glass studio and you ' ll discover a world full of color and light .
` ` the <UNK> evolved over the years into a teaching studio , ' ' <UNK> said .
he said the classes offered at the <UNK> provide a comfortable environment where learning is simple .
by far one of the best hot dogs in madison .
terrific spot for a noon time lunch during the week best cajun in madison .
they seem to loose sight of what it means to detail a car .
another nice touch is the availability of at least three types of beer on tap .
a bonus is that they offer brown rice for no additional charge .
i took a friend from japan there and he thought the sushi was exceptional .
i have been to all of the locations but i frequent the park rd . location the most .
they have a tremendous craft beer selection at all locations .
they even have beer special nights where virtually all beers are $ 0.00 each !
they specialize in philly cheese steaks and are probably the best in town !
like i said - overall pretty good for what it is .
you travel up a private , dedicated elevator 000 - some feet above the strip to the restaurant .
i ca n't say enough about the food and service here .
the decor is kitschy - crap all over the place .
the food pricing is way too expensive for iceberg salad , adequate garlic bread and mediocre wine .
over-priced , overrated and a tourist trap with a miraculously good reputation .
i have read some of the negative reviews and let me say this .
the hours are fine , the pricing is right and the fun level is off the <UNK> scale .
i urge you to experience how wonderful jump city is .
i have read some of the negative reviews and let me say this .
the hours are fine , the pricing is right and the fun level is off the <UNK> scale .
i typically go with one of two classics - a vodka martini or an old fashioned .
both are probably of the better variations of those drinks that i ' ve had .
places like this are making me really enjoy the downtown revival that ' s been happening of late .
this little speakeasy off the beaten path is definitely worth a stop .
major props to the cb for expanding their patio areas as well .
you also seem to get a decent pour for your buck unlike some places around town .
they also host a slew of special events of varying themes and levels of debauchery .
plus , where else can you see drag queens and line dancing all in the same night ?
they ' re very well thought out and always hit the spot .
of course , a sake bomb or two could easily solve this problem for you .
i had a consultation and as previously diagnosed - gum <UNK> were in my future .
the big day arrived , and i showed up properly <UNK> .
believe it or not , i ' m not a gum <UNK> expert .
granted grilled corn is always a winner in my book .
but whatever they smear and drizzle all over the top really makes it outstanding .
raise your corn cob in the air and pray to the peking duck taco gods !
do n't get me wrong - their food is top notch as well .
i also looooove the pork milanese - the onion strings and clarified butter really make it top notch !
and trust , i was in need of a beer or 00 .
she ' s been chopping my hair for over two years and has never let me down .
is it possible to feel inspired while getting your hair cut ?
they have a 0 hour <UNK> , and i ' m consistently never early .
even then , good ol ' sky harbor performs well .
i ' m particularly impressed with the local restaurants that have taken up shop in terminal 0 .
the whole restaurant is like taking a step back in time .
i looked around hoping one of the diners was a gangster arranging a deal or something .
my vodka martini was expertly mixed , as one would expect .
we had two cuts - i did the new york strip - lrb - excellent - rrb - !
my boo opted for the porterhouse - that ' s right 00 oz .
so , next time you ' re in , check out the 0000 plaque on the wall .
the only thing i do n't get - why is n't durant ' s listed as a steakhouse ?
i ' m half tempted not to review it in fear it will start to get more picked over .
definitely worth a look , albeit unpredictable what you might find .
the one critique i might make - i love yellowtail .
a perfect neighborhood sushi place when you want just a roll or two to wrap the night up .
this is one of my secret spots in vegas for a nice drink and cigar .
patience is key - - the cocktail waitresses are a bit slow to notice you sometimes .
thanks to it ' s popularity : to be avoided .
packed full of <UNK> tourists from la who do not smoke cigars .
' ' i think some of the reviews here say it all .
it ' s all t-shirts and <UNK> shorts with no class .
due to their competing locations across the street from each other , the choice is smash or <UNK> .
i would defiantly go back for a sin city - lrb - hold the egg - rrb - .
sake selection was impressive , but overpriced in a major way .
they have sake <UNK> who did an adequate job of suggesting bottles for us .
i wo n't go back , but only because i think my standards are higher for this price .
i think the clumsy sake selection and <UNK> overpriced sake list tainted my overall impression .
we went to the original on maryland parkway when my wife and i were dating 00 years ago .
the real draw , for us , is : the ` ` gyros in pita ' ' is awesome .
lots of meat , plenty of veg , and a wonderful tzatziki sauce .
this place is just solid : never had a bad experience here in over 00 years !
like something out of a futuristic , but tasteful , movie .
i could see some filming being done here real soon .
typical <UNK> in other respects though : casino , shops , lounges , shows , etc . .
a nice spot in the sense that the t-shirt / shorts crowd seems to avoid it .
when we visit , now on the northwest side of town , einstein remains a treat .
coffee just right , lemonade and other drinks not too sweet , bagels perfect .
reviewers say this is the best thai in vegas , maybe even north america .
i mean , i ' d never drive into this outdoor mall area on a whim .
i was here in 0000 and found it to be wildly good , but cramped and hot .
thai beers perfectly <UNK> the <UNK> heat put off by those evil little green thai chiles .
but , that ' s really my problem being so ignorant .
whatever it is , it ' s probably good or great anyway .
sushi rice should be fresh and have a slight tang from a little sugar and rice wine vinegar .
you should not be able to smear it on the roof of your mouth with your tongue .
service was fine , but strained due to severe language or accent barrier .
went based on the positive reviews here , which i found to be accurate .
this is an authentic japanese grill house : no sushi - lrb - thank god - rrb - .
only two comments in negative zone : restaurant is a bit on the warm side .
one of the best sake lists i ' ve seen anywhere , and excellent food .
this is one of the best places in vegas for a great dinner away from the strip <UNK> .
service , atmosphere , menu , and preparation all 00 out of 00 .
pretentiousness / glam factor : 0 or 0 out of 00 .
sake menu diverse , competent , and not <UNK> priced - - a rarity .
fois gras custard and <UNK> number is one of the best things i ' ve had in years .
worse , i heard this said to a few other customers while i was there <UNK> .
red rock is a nice hotel that is great for locals avoiding strip attitude .
the bar staff gets to know your wants and needs the more you go .
in fact , the whole team played a great part .
one minor mistake with a salad tonight ; but , that ' s it .
i ' m thinking the steaks are saltier due to the <UNK> .
besides a brief hiatus due to a cold , i go about 0-0 times a week .
they always welcome and see me off with a smile and a greeting .
do the steam room in ` ` sets ' ' of ` ` reps ' ' as it is amazing .
had the baked ravioli , baked ziti , and the special , king crab legs .
and yet again the same cashier , middle-aged guy with light brown hair plays stupid with me .
' ' dude , you ' ve been at this store for 00 years .
expensive for what you could get at a regular japanese restaurant in chinatown .
i had to call at 0:00 pm to check on car .
sears , this was a chance for you to earn my business .
now , i will remind people why you could soon go out of business .
wrong again i arrived at 0:00 and ordered my large cheese pizza .
i ' m a regular , eating here at least once a week .
just tired of the ` ` robotic ' ' greeting .
we went there for a quiet dinner only to realize it was the last game of march madness .
you should always ask for <UNK> or caroline in men ' s !
took them 00 minutes to seat us even with several table open .
<UNK> - lrb - only 0 tables full - rrb - .
brisket , sausage , chopped pork , ribs , potato salad , beans , all good .
same <UNK> ' car wash upsale b . s . could n't do as promised on <UNK> out paint <UNK> .
definitely gon na try dolphin on power for next wash or detail .
have only had delivery , but the food has always been on point .
no presume to buy , answered all of our ? ? s .
the mattress is great no more back pain and great rest .
they handed those out while you waited to get in to the building .
solid , nostalgic burgers made with high quality ingredients at a reasonable price .
the shake was made with delicious real ice cream and the building g is clean and well designed !
the burger was prepared perfect and the service was quick and sufficient .
a real family cinema , still run by the same family that ' s been in charge for decades .
but unlike many such places , this one has n't fallen behind the times .
but i ' m only giving it two stars rather than one for the views out .
the food would disgrace a greasy spoon or burger bar .
it may look as if it ' s going to be nice , but do n't be fooled .
oh , and their ` ` <UNK> if harry potter ' ' claim either .
pity , the place itself is worth a look , despite the seriously excessive prices .
that ' s now a few <UNK> exhibits shoved into a back corner .
but a place which deliberately treats its customers like ignorant <UNK> ?
apart from the sharks etc . where else can you actually stroke a <UNK> ?
but warning , eat before going , or find somewhere else nearby .
they presumably just assume they have a captive audience and simply do n't care .
the worst public golf i ' ve ever experienced in the many years i ' ve been golfing with friends .
we had to skip the putting portion on several holes to get him off out backs .
i ' ve never used scuba equipment before , and they are supposed to be the experts .
i came with a group of 00 people to watch sunday football .
one year ago , i would have rated the place a four out of five .
since that time , the staff has gone straight to crap .
front desk girls are typically either rude or indifferent and some of the trainers are jerks .
i ' ve never seen so many fake <UNK> in my life .
you must be kidding me , gold ' s gym .
the service is inconsistent - sometimes our server is excellent , other times the service is beyond poor .
i ' ve never had anything here that was bad or good , frankly .
at the end of the day , i typically regret a trip to claim jumper .
at an average of 00-00 bucks for two , there are many better options in the phoenix market .
anyways turns out the bar charge us a <UNK> of $ 00 to open a tab .
well that single transaction caused a decline on our other purchase at a different bar near by .
my wife ask the manager why do n't you have a sign that explains the simple process .
very thin walls - i could hear the person in the room next to me eating .
you could hear paper <UNK> as i think they were eating a cheeseburger or something .
great experience at the wild horse pass resort & spa .
i see a lot of stuff here i do n't normally see .
other than that its like a normal hooters with some new wing flavors and steak fries .
i had an <UNK> incident at one of the hotels i was staying at .
they are triple aaa affiliated and they fix my car very quickly at a very affordable rate .
however it took almost 0 hrs for dinner to completed .
so a lot <UNK> was paid to him and his staff .
hey <UNK> ! ! ! best nyc style pizza in town !
plus very friendly staff and owners ; - rrb - great local restaurant bread is fresh baked .
screaming roll is good , has a citrus taste with shrimp tempura .
bread is a little dry but the meat was good .
i asked her why and she replied that they only had 0 servers and no busboy .
i ' ll try it again if i ' m in the area .
my gf ordered the beef stroganoff and i ordered the pork chop .
i changed my order to the fresh fish of the day which turned out to be good .
from sushi to chinese , thai , and korean dishes .
great place to come and shoot in a / c controlled ranges .
if your a member you <UNK> do n't have to wait .
i ' ve taken ccw and defensive shotgun classes here .
$ 0.00 <UNK> banh mi sandwich ! ! ! most dishes under $ 00 !
great food along w friendly service in a relaxed modern setting .
they have excellent martini ' s that are filled to the top of the glass .
the mojito ' s are the best next to being in miami and ordering one .
the food is good and can be shared in most cases .
i never order steak there bc it does n't measure up to flemings , mastros etc . .
the second time was to fix my rv garage door .
rusty easily diagnosed the problem and ordered the correct springs .
i figured since he was here might as well have him tune up the main garage door .
once again they came through this time for my other rv garage door .
rusty just had to <UNK> the door to the motor .
once again if you need an honest garage door company with fair pricing call triple b . impressed .
food and service were excellent the decor is leather and wood with low lighting .
second visit i ordered their famous french dip with au jus .
excellent , lean cuts of rare beef also ordered a cup of clam chowder .
our 0th time n the service n food is still great the crispy chicken sandwich is really good .
the ribs were fantastic again went here for my birthday w my gf and daughter .
chicken tikka pizza made on naan bread is different but good .
i ' ve eaten here several times and at the location in dc .
very good choice for the $ mom and pop operation .
great place to grab a good strong drink and some light food options .
cheers to hanny ' s ; - rrb - - rrb - - rrb - fell short of expectations .
their lobster tempura roll was ok not as good as a sushi restaurant would do .
the sides of cilantro lime rice , mashed potato and broccoli were excellent .
very clean and friendly ; - rrb - - rrb - - rrb - - rrb - quality and variety are still there .
i remember why i have n't eaten at a kona grill in a long time .
very small filets in a watered down version of <UNK> sauce .
if you want a really authentic mexican seafood meal go to mariscos <UNK> in mesa .
the lead agent / <UNK> - lrb - anthony <UNK> - rrb - was helpful and informative .
he gave me accurate info based on the description of my house and its contents .
chance was the <UNK> , his fellow workers were lance , <UNK> , and martin .
all 0 were polite , hard working , fast , and efficient .
the beer and wine list is extensive with plenty of good offerings .
the olive order was definitely very good and a good portion .
they really should build another oven in the bungalow next door versus sending people over there to wait .
they ' d be just as busy but they ' d get people in n out quickly .
but maybe they just want to stay a small operation .
my wife would go back but maybe not if the wait is over 00mins .
parlor , grimaldi ' s etc . filet mignon was excellent !
love their philly cheesesteak , filet mignon / gorgonzola , and prickly pear chicken sandwiches .
strong drinks ; - rrb - tried the deviled eggs ; - rrb - i had the ahi tuna w a great salad .
the tuna was sashimi style ; - rrb - great fish tacos .
he explained every detail of our lease along with audi customer perks .
if your looking for a low pressure sales experience then i highly recommend paul .
gave us some advice on maintaining the unit and fixed the problem .
we ' ll definitely call him again if any of the other units need service .
sliced thin n ` ` cooked ' ' in garlic sauce / broth table side .
authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes .
halibut tacos remind me of <UNK> michelada with <UNK> beer is a perfect beverage for any dish .
it was 000pm and we were the only table being served .
the latest yelp reviews complained about poor service n rude wait staff .
there are plenty of good korean restaurants in the valley .
i ' m not saying the servers are rude just slow and very slow .
great view of the edinburgh castle from our room and a nice lounge for platinum members .
do n't let the ` ` sheraton ' ' fool you - focus on the ` ` grand ' ' .
if you see <UNK> , keep walking ... there are better places in town .
bright colors and fresh squeezed juices get everything going right .
a thinly sliced ribeye with a great char to the cooked .
still being left medium rare with a great cook on the meat takes skill .
the potatoes are hash with a flat almost fettuccine cut .
they are finished with a great crispy edges to give them good texture .
the combo plate and two side had brisket , pulled pork , & hot link .
it had plenty of moisture but not heavy rendered fat .
finally the hot link was hot enough without canceling out the flavors .
the sauce on the table had flavor with just a little heat .
the location has zero parking and the dinning area is challenging .
the mix of sauces cheese and topping have a full flavor in every bite .
this very small hole in the wall has very authentic italian dishes .
the sauce was plentiful and there was no shortage of meat in her dish .
the pasta was also fresh and a perfect al dente .
the secret to the great flavor is that the crust is cooked with an <UNK> oven .
the toppings are fresh the staff is helpful and energetic .
the long ribbons of rosemary infused pasta paired well with the braised beef .
the $ 0 beers and $ 0 margaritas were huge and delicious .
sat at a table in the bar for 00 minutes with the wait staff ignoring us .
i ' m only staying because my wife wants to try it .
my wife <UNK> the roasted chicken and i had the pappardelle and both were phenomenal .
great for a date , or for the family , or even alone .
i had the teriyaki chicken , the rest of my family had the general tso ' s chicken .
good steak , friendly service , and good view of the tvs from the bar
these guys have a nice little patio overlooking the strip .
i would recommend lavo for a <UNK> drink , matched w / a good cigar .
this particular thursday night at <UNK> was sort of our las vegas welcoming party .
well , tom called back to give the estimate of $ 000.00 .
on top of that , more procedures were added that were never discussed .
when asked why , was told there was no time .
they were fast on their delivery ; however , they sent me the wrong cheesesteak .
. food was delicious and the bbq ribs fell off the bone this place is fantastic .
the place is always super clean and is just a very nice place to eat
. thank you <UNK> for a great dinning experience ... you guys will be seeing .
. mind you i order it 00 min till close ... it was so dam good .
you have to try their premium saki , so good .
for me service is the key to a great meal .
so stop by today and get real service like no other .
you have to love korean food in order to enjoy the fusion of both .
living in san diego i got a lot of mexican food being so close to the border .
have a plan , walk around and look 0 the ` ` total package ' ' and go 0 it .
walked around miracle mile shops and decided too get something to eat .
there are 0 pools here , kiddie pool with sand and waterfall .
the name throws u off ? ? sounds like a biker bar .
so if your driving in from california exit early at south point and head north on lv blvd . .
only reason it ' s getting any stars is cause of the service .
the food is of the highest quality with perfectly balanced flavor .
instead of any sort of apology , she just started in with excuses .
to me , this is a classic b . s . sales technique .
but , as a customer with kids , i think this is a horrible strategy .
do n't start with excuses , start with an apology that my expectations have n't been met .
the service , food , and atmosphere were very good .
he also did a great job of introducing options without seeming like he was pushing or selling anything .
his knowledge of the menu , wine list , and cocktail options was exceptional .
the wine pairing tablet was also very helpful and made great suggestions .
they really stood out because they were not overly compressed and did not contain too much filler .
it was tender , juicy , and had an excellent flavor profile that was truly worth the cost .
if you like frozen corn , then this would be fine .
very generous portion with a creamy texture and nicely seasoned .
they remove from the recipe raisins and nuts and add pineapple for a nice balanced sweetness .
this made the cake a bit one <UNK> and limited its potential .
my wife ' s order - lrb - of course i tasted everything !
as an aside , please do n't eat or cook pork well-done .
this is an outdated food safety practice that is not necessary , and completely <UNK> out the meat .
the overall preparation was good , not <UNK> and gummy , but they were a bit grainy .
the breakfasts at this outpost were at the opposite end of the spectrum .
the chocolate pancakes were ok , but how can you not have excellent choco pancakes ?
this is a <UNK> <UNK> ... it ' s also good to know where to park .
do n't pay full price for tickets , stub hub has great deals for almost every game .
i was on the other side of town for me and stopped in for a quick bite .
i liked that it had an ever so slight char to it .
especially when they all stopped to do <UNK> bombs love love love yogurtland .
only drawback is that it can get <UNK> and the seating area is n't that big .
had a groupon decided to check it out , steak was good , server was lacking .
i have eaten at a lot of buffets in town .
did n't expect it to be as nice as it was .
the whole thing took about 0 months to resolve and i had to do it on my own .
they are under alot of <UNK> to open new accounts .
apparently this leads them to commit fraud and management looks the other way .
fun to people watch if you get a table outside as people walk the strip .
the chicken <UNK> is a great dish from upstate ny .
nice to go to a local restaurant that is n't a chain .
shorter than most reviews and sweeter than a quick tip .
the <UNK> and timing of the moving platforms and water are like nothing else in this world .
shorter than most reviews and sweeter than a quick tip .
where the comedic act was 00 times funnier than family guy ?
yet , it was f @ * & ing right but so f @ * & ing wrong .
yes , it ' s that f @ * & ing wrong .
this pizza joint is down an unassuming hallway close to the marquee nightclub .
i do n't think you can go wrong with any pizza here especially if you are buzz .
the waitress had a terrible attitude and a face to match .
this is the only place where i actually like there sushi .
for pittsburgh being pretty far from a ocean this joint got awesome fresh fishes all the time .
hands down the most slept on pizza shop in pittsburgh .
not your typical pizza which puts it light years ahead of the rest of the pizza game .
waited over a hr for a table just to be disappointed .
its a little pricey but the service was top notch .
so i ordered the colossal red velvet cake and i must say colossal describes it perfectly .
and especially if i was trying to impress a lady friend .
i consider myself a asshole so this place just feels right too me .
dont be surprised if you waiter keeps it a little to real .
like i said its like a <UNK> dinner so expect a little attitude from the waitress .
after reading all the horrible reviews about this hotel / casino i prepared myself for the worst .
as it turns out , this is not that bad of a place .
my first stop in montreal and it feels like i ' m being fed from a soup kitchen .
avoid this place , it ' s a convenience trap .
i ' ve been at many events at <UNK> and yet to leave dissatisfied .
fortunately the other mechanic was able to save me some cash and prevent a nightmare situation financially .
even more fortunate , i was n't killed driving the car back to my house .
in conclusion ; i could n't wait to get back to red devil after five years .
i am a big college football fan and a long <UNK> of asu .
this is n't as much a knock on <UNK> as it is the ticket sales department .
so , a few days later , my wife and i call to see about purchasing .
the experience there was fantastic and further sold us on purchasing the tickets .
this mistake , after two extremely disappointing experiences , will not happen again .
. it could n't have spent more than 0 minutes on the grill .
my wife ' s salmon <UNK> was cooked ... a little too much .
he makes certain that if you are in his gym , you leave each class learning something new .
he does n't rush and make you feel lesser if you do n't get it right out .
however the city of mesa should really push hard to get a minor league team here .
shame to see such a nice stadium used so <UNK> .
i wo n't forget the good times i ' ve had at bww on grove avenue .
everyone from john <UNK> and <UNK> henderson on down the line treat everyone with the highest respect .
seems like it ' s just a matter of time before the entire mall goes bankrupt .
i ca n't imagine they ' re making much money remaining open .
used to go to this joe ' s location somewhat regularly back in 0000-0000 until we relocated .
needless to say , while the outside remained the same , much else has changed .
inside is completely different and menu wise it is substantially different .
' ' other than this , joe ' s is a nice little establishment .
price is a bit steep and the staff should be a little more aware of pricing .
pros : great family atmosphere especially if you have kids .
food is always good service is a plus the ambiance and play on theme .
hell of a nice guy and great at his job .
discovered culvers on a road / business trip in 0000 .
rare is food better than advertised , however this burger was far and away better .
then she ate one and was as hooked as i .
the burgers are off the chain and customer service is always great .
would be better if you did away with some of those idiotic kiosks with pushy sales people .
fill out their necessary paperwork and see that the place is relatively empty .
is sea life going to compare to some of the gems in california ?
you ' re better off putting your games for sale on craigslist .
at least there you ' ll get somewhat of a fair return price for it .
sad , this was once the station to tune into .
the food is amazing chef matt carter certainly knows what he is doing with his new concept .
our server certainly gave us the right direction because every plate left empty and everyone loved everything .
then she charged full price for it on the bill on top of that !
it was an odd <UNK> of flavours , but we did n't come here for typical restaurant fare .
i had the off menu - lrb - and highly recommended by our server - rrb - veal shank with cauliflower mash .
really soft textures with a few lumps here and there .
mixed in with the juices of the shank and you got this beautiful velvety texture .
and that ' s what it felt like after a while .
the soft texture eventually reminded me of cutting and chewing into raw flesh .
the coffee of the day was real good , though i forget the title .
this place still gets four stars because a - rrb - they serve and sell fantastic beans , b - rrb - .
sad to say that this sandwich was the epitome of mediocrity despite how beautiful it looked .
the one redeeming quality was the coffee , which hit the spot and had great flavour .
been coming here for years and it never seems to <UNK> in quality or service .
but that could just be me trying to be an amateur food critic .
or if you ' re normal , you ' ll limit yourself and ask for a takeout box .
i also got to try the four cheese pizza , and that was spot on .
pizza , breads , pastries , desserts ... all top notch .
i ' ve been coming here for years and it ' s one of laval ' s best offerings .
however , i ' ll play the pho game and can say that this was one very good meal !
flavorful broth , fresh veg , and a good protein - what more can i say ?
to top it off , it was a ridiculously inexpensive meal .
glad to say that this place is not all style .
this is a cool , hip , and modern resto that is totally pretentious and that ' s ok .
i want to hate this place , but i ca n't .
ordered the special burger trio and the burger was superb .
it ' s a patty that ' s far superior to other fast food joints , hence the 0 stars .
next time i go , i ' m definitely doing two burgers and skipping the fries .
if you ' re in the area , you got ta go .
previous reviewer sold me on it and i ' m glad he did .
a part of the sausage - lrb - see pic - rrb - looked really awkward .
the fruit was also underwhelming but hey , $ 0.00 here .
there was one busboy that was <UNK> all the wait staff with his speed and accuracy .
i came here this week and had an experience very similar to my experiences in laval ' s locations .
<UNK> mon coco has now franchised itself and i could n't be happier for this joint .
other that that , this place is fantastic and is a solid choice for sunday morning breakfast .
stopped by here on my way for some fresh bagels and the coffee did n't disappoint .
this place reeks of montreal and it ' s fantastic .
tip my hat to that kitchen team because that was one mind blowing food experience .
i also tried the mac and cheese , which was delicious .
<UNK> is the reason i have cut off ` ` all you can order ' ' restaurants .
some of the sushi pieces were minuscule , some larger .
those two items stood out amongst the rest of the dinners mediocrity .
in fact , if this was a restaurant , i ' d consider coming back for it !
i would not go out of my way for this place .
0 stars is me being nice and realizing my bias against all you can order restos .
that thing is crazy good , and the comparisons to funnel cake are spot on .
i think i caught these guys on a bad day because my chicken was not on its <UNK> .
the skin , typically the best part , did n't separate from the chicken and felt caked on .
... but half a grape ? ! a slice of orange ?
as long as i ' m served <UNK> and treated well , there ' ll be no complaints .
based on my meal , i ' d say <UNK> ' s falls in the middle .
<UNK> is a decent restaurant in park ex and pretty cheap .
it ' s not a traditional pakistani dish and their interpretation of it was poor .
also tried a fish dish that came on a hot plate with some other veggies .
nice chunk of beef with great mashed potatoes and some bacon .
i did n't know eggs benedict could actually be good .
like a bedroom with a couple of tables and narrow paths .
vieux <UNK> ' s hollandaise was n't smothering the eggs and it actually had a pleasant taste .
my gf and i love breakfasts and we just so happen to live minutes away from this place .
if you ' re a two eggs and sausage type of guy , you ' ve hit gold .
the only thing that is off about this place is when it comes down to the bill .
i ' ve had a few other pizzas at mozza and none of them live up to this combination .
this pizza is five stars sitting in a 0.0 star restaurant .
it ' s served with a very uniquely shaped spaghetti that is absolutely essential to this dish .
the dish is like your <UNK> ' s sunday night dinner except its available every day .
glad we did because those noodles , though not ramen , are fine .
i ordered the braised beef shank noodle soup and it was just plain great .
the beef was tender and the bok choy was a great filler .
it ' s like they think all people are 00lbs and 0 feet tall ? ? - - ca ` <UNK> .
drove through here to do some errands and stopped here for dinner on a whim .
<UNK> makes a fine souvlaki but you got ta eat it fresh .
and you want the meat to be hot to contrast that cool tzaziki sauce .
just writing this makes me wish i had one right now .
i mean , who else does a mac and cheese burger bun ?
for what it is , this place gets a full 0 stars .
it ' s a bakery that sells hot buns , dessert buns , and pastries / cakes for cheap .
if you ' re hungry and buy six buns , there ' s also no tax .
the server , presumably the wife to the operation , is sweet and really takes care of you .
my protein , the grilled chicken , was pretty plain and had nothing distinct about it .
the maitre ' d / owner / host was flat out rude to some guests .
could i ever recommend this place for its food and service ?
it ai n't top notch quality but it gets the job done .
they ' re simple in ingredients but packed with flavour .
this is a decent place with interesting burger combos and eclectic decor .
i always go for the sweet potato fries and the spicy mayo , both fantastic .
i ' m not a cocktail guy , and this place certainly did n't convert me .
this place is already awesome and its reviews show it .
so here are a series of <UNK> that i feel would fit their marketing <UNK> .
it is a pity that your pita is not - - from <UNK> !
like , i ' m at least 00 % chicken wing now .
dry rub , spicy , bbq - all with <UNK> names .
