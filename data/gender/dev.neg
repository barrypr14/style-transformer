. the packed dance floor .
octopus salad and kale salad were both good .
has live bands come on weekends often .
my favorite in pit .
consistent and delicious food .
- rrb - on the ceiling above the bed .
that was one of my favorite dishes from there .
can not speak highly enough about it .
everything i tasted was excellent .
one big plus : the coffee is always fantastic .
i must say that it exceeded my expectations .
their vanity was a bit tiny .
not sure if they validate parking .
lovely decor , truly , it was .
the service is kinda weird .
totally thought of the <UNK> at <UNK> .
this place was worth the wait !
we had a great experience and will go back !
this place is great !
the hummus was nice , as well .
all i can say is yum !
just describing it makes me crave it again .
it came out like a hockey puck .
i ca n't wait to go back !
seriously , i think my mouth had an orgasm .
<UNK> perfectly med-rare and the flavors were perfect .
my favorite cupcake is the strawberry shortcake .
but it tasted good !
plus , the growler are cute here , too .
and we were overcharged $ 0.00 .
if so , that is pretty <UNK> .
it is n't aimed at an upscale clientele .
$ 0 for my dress to be <UNK> .
they also have a million flavors to choose from .
super efficient kitchen that just <UNK> along .
this was the place to go .
just a little too much for me .
i grew up going to this place .
i had judy as my foot therapist .
you made my day !
i left our meal feeling a little disappointed .
we had people scamming the system .
the building that it is in is so pristine .
first and last time <UNK> .
no , it was not .
i strongly recommend this animal hospital for your pets .
mentioned yelp for the $ 0 discount .

so , steak and cheese quesadilla on wheat .
it was indeed spicy , but still very flavorful .
i like this taco bell !
we walked in , and seated ourselves .
i <UNK> every time the music started blasting .
simple , delish , and fun .
needless to say , i changed my email .
and then , the sushi came .
my husband and i usually just share the smallest .

just to many things happening without any balance .
the shop is super cute .

the fried pickles were awesome .
they have a great wine selection , too .
also , the phone number listed is wrong .
my boyfriend got the waygu hamburger i believe .
our server lou was great .
customer service is horrible and it takes forever .
the hotel in general was weird .
there was no shaker and there was no sugar .
service was excellent & food was fantastic !
the avocado and egg were fresh .
the food is still amazing .
$ 0.00 is n't too bad though .
<UNK> has completely changed my outlook on this .
bagel bin is yummy !
the nachos were for us and they were fabulous .

he <UNK> the cards , we <UNK> and left .
it ' s worth it .
good flavor , sauce and amount of toppings .
fresh fruits and exotic vegetables , awesome asian trinkets .
the owners are very charming .
sundays during football season are the best here .
i think my expectations were too high .
i always get the tonkatsu ramen .
definitely worth trying out !

instead we got chips and salsa for $ 0 .
i ordered the greek salad with chicken .
what a lovely menu !
there was no fishy taste .
the protein pancakes are heavenly !
i would drive across town for this place .
that ' s great customer service .
staff was friendly too .
there was an <UNK> and hard bump .
give that man a raise ... whomever can !
we appreciated that much for sure .
ok , so i guess we are unloading everything .
whose spot on with their food .
three of us shared two entrees and were stuffed .
all their food looks yummy on pictures .
their rolls are good but not worth the price .

got home , looked at the salad .
this is a must have if you go !
we were close by , so we stopped in .
then of course there is the fantastic food .
i do n't know how to <UNK> .
thank you for the fun experience .
what ... was ... her problem ?
drinks are pricy too and nothing impressive .
and the kids loved it to .
i found the staff at the ticketing desk curt .
the service is attentive and organized and personal .
they also had a great beer and cocktail list .
. so we thought to try it .
we ordered our first round of cocktails .
it always seems to be just what i need .
i ordered the month special and it was good !
they have live jazz on thursdays .

but terribly inefficient line .
i ca n't say enough positive things about <UNK> .
we sat outside and it was a gorgeous day .
overall , it was a fulfilling experience .
this place is beyond great .
the rooms are huge !
this is one of my favorite bars in vegas .
it was pretty busy when we got there .
dim lighting and dark furniture .
i ' ve had a lot .
we had a fabulous time having drinks and talking .
they have outdoor seating as well which is covered .
their staff and their volunteers are incredibly helpful .
i had the <UNK> and it was good .
i am so glad i did .
that ' s just not safe .
honestly , it ' s my biggest complaint .
my heart sank ... .
it was great vibe .

and we do - - fast !
they even hooked us up with free beer .
service was great too !
the beets salad was wonderful .
i will be back , for sure .
it was n't cooked through at all .
the best hawaiian fusion breakfast .

the lines are decent for such a popular venue .
i love this place !
i could n't finish it .

. but short blonde hair - rrb - .
my son had a gyro kid meal .
felt full and not ` ` gross ' ' .
we walked in observing bathtubs filled with rose petals .
jill is the best !
i love this store !
and voila , you make your own drink !

what a difference the lack of desperation makes .
i ca n't wait to go again .
my omelet was awful .
- rrb - warning : do not live here !

tight space , but i did n't mind .

bernie has been my main man for years .
prime rib a bit salty .
my bestie and i stayed here 0 years ago .

thank you <UNK> for such a fun experience .

the best burgers in town !
no social skills whatsoever which really confused me .
that made their customer service terrible .
love love love this place .
it was n't horrible , but just ok .

that is what they are !
great sammies ... i especially love the bobbie .

just not impressed this time .
the wait during sundays is long .
the mussels three ways was sooo freaking good too .
... a drink dammit !
i ' m really shocked and hurt !
truly , the movers went above and beyond .

the food is delicious .
i hope they figure it out !
or some parsley maybe .
my cocktail , however was delicious .
the food here is so good !
i do n't know .
... all incredibly salty too .
i hate coming to walmart for this reason !
always friendly , and always busy .
i took two sips and was done .
awesome service and delicious korean food .
i needed an <UNK> box for shipping .
my dogs were fairly happy after the office visit .
i think it ' s worth the extra money .
they have over 00 flavors .
it ' s the best .
cashier checked ... told i was wrong .
i was pleasantly suprised and really loved it .
so i bite again only , bread .
pretty sure the restaurant lost money on their visit !
i ' ve never heard such a thing .
great , friendly service .
we came here for mother ' s day .
service is friendly and attentive .
i would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone !
the fries are delicious and well seasoned .

chips were warm and fresh and so good .
i was outraged , like is ever return !
it was only okay .
the food was very <UNK> and authentic .
everything was super fresh and delicious !
such a tiny portion .
dance floor was crowded but not packed .
it came well done and was tasteless .
back to the main thing though - the food !
she reminded me of my grandmother .
the people working here are so friendly and polite .
how do i love thee , <UNK> ?
and the pizza was just meh .
over all we enjoyed our stay at the luxor .
i love this place !
arrival : no one was there but us .

the food is delicious and the service is amazing .

how would i ever choose ?
i ' ve definitely had better .
i only went in for their macaroons .
friendly staff and clean store .
we both ordered the <UNK> four course meal .

it ' s not the real thai food .
i honestly can not recommend them enough .
yum ! ! ladies bathroom disgusting .
first of all , the concept was brilliant .
i ' ll probably be back !
the staff was very friendly , and helpful .
this was what the concierge lounge was all about .
for airport food , i really was n't disappointed .
the staff was fabulous !
the slowest service ever in charlotte !
they dont have a restroom .

all our dishes showed up as ordered .
theyre also now called preferred cleaners .

unfortunately , this place was a big letdown .
i love this place great atmosphere .

excellent service & delicious food !
and <UNK> of course .
the <UNK> were very good !
it was okay , but not spectacular .
i love <UNK> library .
i received with onion and toasted !
and a liquor person .

i ' d rather go to cabo fish taco .
it was delicious with mushroom sauce and string beans .
we usually order delivery from this location .
the entrees were decent .
they are a fabulous greek restaurant ! !
my suggestion ; go there hungry !
ca n't be beat for $ 0 .
thank you to all .
anyway , i just loved this splash pad !
great people working there !
i just want to vomit .
<UNK> ' up the brownie points .
i recommend her to everyone .
they are the best .
i think it ' s a pretty balanced cupcake .
the best falafel of my life .
it ' s literally a 00-00 person seating area .
the pickles that came with it were great though .
another perk is how much later their hh goes .
- lrb - at least not yet .
so glad i called <UNK> .
i was <UNK> optimistic and gently dropped .
what i did not love was the lobster taco .
thrilling , i know .
friendly staff and delicious food !
the grade at the location is 00 health inspection .
the <UNK> shots are n't half bad here too !
the food was a bit <UNK> for me .
i really wish bands would stop doing shows here .
he also checked the bathtub area .
i wanted to come here and see for myself .
i could feel my teeth breaking into each layer .
great food , good service , wonderful over-all experience !
employees are not as friendly as the other group .
people holding vip tickets ended up going first .
it was just all too much for me .
will definitely be back .
he finished with strawberry mochi .
they had endless options for food .
mom had a fish sandwich and fries .
what an awesome experience .
save yourself some time and do n't move here .
i even went back and ordered the <UNK> .
do i look like her now ?
ab fab and totally <UNK> idea !
totally freakin ' awesome .
they were ok , but andy is the best .
made me utterly sick .
i also ordered the curry <UNK> .
egg rolls were disgusting .
i wish i could have taken a picture .
our server <UNK> rocks !
very disappointed by their treatment and disregard for customers .
not a big place so make reservations .
we love the apple roll !
these tasted like cardboard .
the complex itself had countless more !
all the dishes were very flavorful .
i ' d bet she did n't inform management .
that ' s where we are happiest anyway .
the atmosphere is beautiful and relaxing .
way to much money for poorly executed rolls .
: - lrb - conference room : comfortable .
thank you planet hollywood !
i got lost coming back from the bathroom .
friendly service and decent portions !
the staff was really friendly also .
the concierge greeted us .
it was protein heaven !
we loved the ribs and fried chicken !
he just stood there and kept yelling .
we ' re adults here .
found no good flavors from the selection except strawberry .
this is a must try !
their fried oysters were crispy and plump .
our waitress was nice .
we were treated like queens .
i will definitely be using him in the future !

we come here exclusively for these ribeye tacos !
first , the service was great and attentive .
my son just participated in their summer reading program .
again the portion was itty bitty .
when i ate it , that confirmed my fear .
very filling and satisfying .
i ' m always greeted very kindly and thanked .
extremely poor customer service .
it definitely exceeded my expectations !
he is now part of our family .
could use another location in highlands ranch !
the stir fried hollow vegetables were cooked perfectly !
the cake bites are delicious !
outstanding customer service at it ' s best .
. highly recommend culver ' s
they went above and beyond for me !
we had to sleep in a double bed .
she was just as great and helpful .

two words to describe everything : fresh and delicious !
this struck me as sketchy .
it ' s all bread .
my fried chicken was delicious .
not far from airport and very easy to find .
used to be a fan .
that ' s exactly what we got !
all of their bread is delicious here .
we received everything fast without any issues .
i tried the <UNK> and fruity .
the food was good as was the service .
suck on the sangria and enjoy a peach margarita !
the owner <UNK> is so nice .
nice to see smaller family owned bookstores around still !
the <UNK> men soup was spicy and delicious !
not like i participate or anything .
the cioppino was not what i recalled .
the service is also awesome .
all he wanted to do was intimidate me .
the flavor profile lacked depth .
in one word ` ` ehh .
tao beach is nothing special for vegas .
the location of this hotel is fabulous .
the poutine was delicious !
both gentlemen were very knowledgeable and very personable .
either get better staff or throw in the towel
bernie and jeremy are my go-to guys !

my daughter did n't even touch it .
always in their fav .
there is no need for it .
a decent selection of food and sushi .
we had plenty of leftovers to take home .
it just melt in your mouth .
i need the recipe asap !
however they made it up to me .
. never will i spend my money here again ...
for $ 0 , it was worth it .
i have to say it was disappointing .
the employees are really professional same as the vets .
do n't waste your money !
yes , that is a mouthful .
a break ? ? my mom was a doctor .
by far the worst sushi i have ever had .
but it was good !
i love filipino food .
lots of seating and enough outlets .
everyone was nice and not pretentious .
pretty delicious , and a lovely shade of lavender .
well , i loved jersey mikes up until now !
the atmosphere is relaxed , elegant , and inviting .
food was drowning in oil .
the sauce on it was very yummy .
it is seriously to die for .
at least it has its own parking lot .
i big puffy heart these women !
amazing food and service !
it ' s the best !
their sangria is also great , super refreshing .
they make your eggs anyway you want them .
that was <UNK> interesting .
save your money and party in vegas proper !
this church had become my favorite event each week .
not a detail was missed .
i ordered the rib eye , medium .
will be coming back !
the food was good but the service was terrible .
fusion specialty bento box !
after that everything was good but not crave worthy .
it was n't all bad , though .
delivery time is fast also .
the fries were soggy .
their sandwiches are delicious too !
i immediately asked to speak to the manager .
it is two stories and is a bar .
. you guessed it !
went to eat here for a friends birthday .
complaint # 0 : my caesar salad .
it ' s fluffy pancake goodness .
i really enjoyed the ricotta <UNK> and burrata .
the service is friendly and quick .
i got about 00 pieces for 00 dollars .
` ` it ' s that .
. downtown mesa needs to get its props .
the beans were crunchy and flavorful .
i definitely will go back !
the dirty could have been more dirty .
it was a fantastic ambiance and service .
soap and amenities are nice , not fabulous .
great service and delicious !
the people on his team were equally wonderful .
she could n't even finish half of her order .
this is not it .
meh , not great .
place was not very clean , nor inviting .
i have never had such bad customer service !
although their dessert was absolutely delectable and huge .
really generous portion for kids meal .
the fish tacos were generously portioned for the price point .
when i saw the fact that this show <UNK> water it peaked my interest !
got my first root canal and i am so glad i came here !
for sushi , their ika was good and their sake - lrb - salmon - rrb - was pretty darn fresh tasting .
needless to say they did n't like when we started a u of a <UNK> ; - rrb -
of course i just got voicemail and 0 days later no one called back .
they should focus less on being trendy and hard to find and more on making amazing sushi .
when i came there , they told me that my order will not be ready til 0 pm .
listen to the waiter he knows what he is talking about
i know , most food is delicious late at night at the bar ... but , for real .
best price i could find in town for iphone 0 screen replacement !
i had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while .
i will try the cream cheese frosting next time and will probably get it from now on .
its the day before my coworkers birthdays when i realize i need to get a pie .
they made sure my boyfriend always had a drink in his hand .
it ' s got a crispy outer shell and soft <UNK> inside .
the bakery offers a lot of goodies and yummy sweets and really good gifts .
i got their full size ham , salami , cheese sandwich on their homemade baguette .
i paid $ 00 for someone to help lotion me up ... that ' s it .
he says no can do but that we are in luck .
ask for water in a kids cup , took them 00min or so .
we spent a beautiful sunday afternoon at rattlesnake cove at <UNK> lake .
however that did n't matter as we all ordered off the mixologist .
overall , great room and even better when it ' s the concierge lounge .
the drinks were yummy and they even let us sit down without ordering bottle service .
the lettuce was nasty - - bitter , hardly any leaf , just nasty .
reminds me of a place back home ... we will be back .
we came here looking for s center stone for my wedding ring .
soooo many flavors and loved ones i never thought i would ever like .
i ' ll go here again but only strictly for sushi .
then when i went to pay with a coupon that included a free meal .
it was served with lima beans , greens , bread crumbs & parmesan in some light olive oil .
their flavors are so fun and unique like rose scented raspberry , or black current tea .
i have been back several times in the past year .
it was super reasonable in price like 00 dollars and very fresh and plated thoughtfully .
my boyfriend and i got dressed up for the night and wanted to go somewhere fancy .
i am so grateful for all she does to make my life <UNK> .
it reminded me so much of the coffee scene in new zealand .
usually i ca n't tell food is salty just from smelling it .
i wished they had their steamed <UNK> like their closed location .
- lrb - - ___ - # - rrb - i love food stands and this is a must try place .
second was crab cake for me and saw bass for my husband .
my fiancã © took me to see the david copperfield show and we loved it !
they have a lot of interesting foods on the menu so i might go back again .
the only good thing the manager did was offer to pay our bill .
i wish i could tell you that this <UNK> has been helpful to my <UNK> .
we cut close 00 % of it off because of all the fat .
loved their homemade , pickled <UNK> and <UNK> - lrb - radishes - rrb - .
they were beyond friendly on the phone and very knowledgeable .
clean room and bathroom which is a must for me !
to start , when we walked in there was a foul smell in the lobby area .
it was awsome ! ! ! food : 0 stars !
been with this office for a couple years now and everytime feel this same frustration .
i ordered two rolls where the spicy tuna was ground up .
sat at the bar with my friend and the bartenders / sushi chefs kept us entertained .
they dont have toppings , <UNK> , chocolate shells , sprinkles , for toppings .
not too salty and the beef was not over cooked .
he took one look at the <UNK> and started to laugh .
i was meeting friends there for a brunch / networking thing , it was four of us all together 0 .
i ordered the classic and i was more than pleased .
do n't get me wrong , the food was n't bad but it was n't spectacular .
as we were eating our main courses , a basket of bread with some olive oil arrived .
the boyfriend had a rib eye and was quite impressed !
we ' ve tried a few different places and this is the best so far .
i had a medium caramel gelato , which was <UNK> tasty .
you are definitely paying for the atmosphere , which is great so makes it worth it .
i like the idea of eating <UNK> food in a <UNK> / comfortable environment .
my husband order the new york steak , which came with really yummy bok choy & asparagus .
i was looking forward to this place , and it was a complete let-down .
he stopped at nothing to make sure we got out of there with what we needed .
i asked , ` ` ca n't she help me ?
another guest had the duck , which was my second choice .
the green beans were seriously the best i ' ve ever had with the perfect amount of batter .
even tho the parents should really be the ones telling the kids to behave .
the staff is nothing short of spectacular and accommodating : they get 0 stars .
even when there are n't many people in the restaurant .
but then i got distracted by the next round of food !
i had no idea where to start , so i asked my friend for a recommendation .
i will definitely be back to this cute little cafe !
i had something called a <UNK> , a spicy blood orange and jalapeã ± o infused martini , very yummy .
the guy that was slicing meat was extremely helpful and joyful .
i work in cross <UNK> and have passed la <UNK> many times .
- lrb - we shopped in the meantime , because there were ample shopping choices nearby .
loved the spicey basil chicken it had a good balance of flavors and texture .
the cashier , anthony , is so kind and welcoming .
there was also some delicious bread as an intro plate , and pistachios , very fresh .
warning , once you have one , it ' ll be really hard to stay away !
i wish there was more locations , since i love north scottsdale and closer to me .
the casino was ok , waitress was rude and never brought my drink .
do n't forget accompany your meal with a glass of sweet tea !
it was just the right amount of sweetness and felt like it melted in my mouth .
it did not give the kind of ambience that so many restaurants in la give .
i had their fish tacos , which was pretty good .
got my food well after everyone else at my table .
we dined at the bar - - the bartender , jordan , was attentive and friendly .
i wish they had some type of caddy to take it all to your table .
but as far as dives go , it ' s awesome !
but i was n't able to pick her up after 0pm !
the food was good , but i prefer meat & potatoes fried chicken and jalepeno waffles .
compared to many artisan shops , the prices are actually very reasonable .
mm - - mmm ... fall-off-the-bone , savory , and sweet .
i could feel the heat coming through the wall i was sitting next to .
bakeries in the area were going to charge me twice as much for the same cake .
we are gold members so we utilized the free wifi .
i saw a coupon on <UNK> on yelp for the weekly pass and picked it up right away .
as for the soup it tasted like water with tons of salt in it .
the owners is are very accommodating , and smiling every time i see them .
not only is the ice cream mediocre , the staff at this location are super rude .
the first couple of times i got it , but it really started to get annoying .
now to the food : some dishes are really delicious .
great seats , fresh popcorn and they serve beer and wine .
i think our total tab was around $ 00 for 0 of us and my son .
however , it was pretty dead at 0: 00 , and we walked straight to the counter .
there ' s not much more to say that has n't been said ... .
they ' re professional , gracious , quick and honest .
i do n't like roller coasters but i have heard from friends that it is an adventure .
0 tables who came in after us got served first .
didnt really pay attention to the table till our food came out .
we needed to fuel our engines , and wanted to try something different than cheesecake factory .
if you want to go somewhere with a great view , this ca n't be beat .
it ' s like a thanksgiving leftover sandwich ... yum !
we were n't dressed up like other people & were younger and did n't feel judged at all .
it ' s not spicy at all and some dishes are even sweet !
we also got the soy pudding and yuzu ice cream .
i do n't think i ' ve ever seen chips and guac for $ 0 .
my boyfriend got the lobster omelette and i ordered the lobster benedict .
well this jersey mikes on paradise road gives you the same experience .
i hated my sub i could n't even finish it .
a okay in my book , but i do n't need to go back again .
- rrb - stepped out of a side front door somewhere and watched with his arms crossed .
i ' m the girl who gets around to it weeks , maybe months later .
i always go to the dog bar like every weekend with my dogs n friends .
love chop shop ! ! ! today at lunch my daughter got the wrong order .
i really was n't feeling it so we left without spending anything .
the fries were hot and fresh and the service was amazing .
it was a bit pricey , but definitely worth it for the quality .
i would have given 0 stars but the fresh rolls we wanted to order were not available .
they gave me 0 generous pieces and some delicious mash potatoes and gravy .
veggies were all fresh and crisp and it was so much i could n't finish the whole cup .
the owners are actively part of the evening and chat with customers .
i was pleased to discover that <UNK> will also custom design jewelry pieces .
go see <UNK> and cj for the professional way to sell you a car ! !
it ' s a bit of a drive , but worth it .
' ' strange , because i did this a while back .
cute and quaint place with a menu that is simple yet elegant .
i do n't think it ' s that overpriced , and i really like hanging out here .
it was about a 0 inch long by maybe 0.0 inch size .
we got in pretty quick , food was really good .
then your feet get worked on and flip over for your back .
before i continue , this place had amazing customer service .
i really dig the living room area of the rooms .
my only complaint is that it was hot inside the restaurant .
& well ... it just was n't my favorite place .
the boards for an appetizer is great and i absolutely loved my dinner of the <UNK> .
when i wanted a deck for the back of my home i ended up calling quaker state construction .
it was really tremendous , and our server was prompt and helpful in menu selections .
i would highly recommend <UNK> for all of your pastry needs .
he was personable and let us know he ' d check things out .
no refills in the tiny water glasses we were given .
i was surprised & relieved to learn that the kobe burger already included fries .
i have to be honest , it was just okay .
we have had friends come from out of town , and we bring them here for breakfast .
the <UNK> is so relevant and easy to listen to .
however , it ' s a cute little restaurant inside an otherwise <UNK> strip mall in boring old gilbert .
i placed a special order not too long ago and it arrived within days !
they have custom ` happy birthday menus ' for you .
i plan to go again and take it in a bit more .
my sister in law and i laughed our ass off .
on the negative side , i realized that i left a blouse in the room after checking out .
i ' m glad the food is better than the customer service i received .
no more searching the pile for the perfect produce they all are perfect .
highly recommended , definitely a regular for us now ever time we ' re in vegas .
little things but it ' s those little things that make a difference .
pretty much know i can get a good burger here , when the mood arises .
i followed her to phoenix , she ' s the best !
a little small , but i think the portions depend on what drink you order .
- lrb - i ' m an ipa kind of girl - rrb - .
people have been known to get there at 0am to reserve the lounge chairs for the 00am games .
would come back for sure , just would n't get this plate again .
so u know i will not be staying here ever again .
i took at vantage of the doggie teeth cleaning special .
tao beach is not about the experience but about who you are with .
let me make a few things clear before i get started : 0 .
i will be coming back and will refer my friends and family .
and the benedict was to die for because ` ` that is the best benedict ive ever had !
the decorations are cool with bunch of egg crates making up the us flag !
the location is great right in the heart of scottsdale and by the fashion square mall .
: o-rrb - my son and i go to this cpk when we ' re shopping at desert ridge .
there was no toilet paper in at least two of the four stalls and the trash was overflowing .
that alfredo sauce was the best alfredo sauce i ' ve ever tasted .
i ' ve been there on several occasions and never noticed that ' s amore .
ordered a cherry almond coke , which was also crazy delicious .
when shopping the first pepper , onion , head of lettuce etc i choose is in good shape .
i drove by this place so many times and i finally ate here !
the bakery is lovely , and the owners are so welcoming !
i recently moved here a few months ago & have visited the wildlife rescue a few times .
thanks to all at gr ' s p & g !
since it was on the way to our doctors office , we decided to check it out .
- rrb - ... they have them and they are to die for !
she was still friendly and attentive , but overall not the greatest experience .
we had vanilla creme brulee for dessert - - yum .
i ordered medium and my burger came out medium rare .
the jerk pulled pork quesadilla had spicy slaw , tomato , <UNK> cheese and cucumber aioli .
ah well , i ' ll be one of those folks someday , too ... .
i told the waiter that we would take 0 glasses instead of the complete bottle .
i ' m not sure why a business would treat customers or potential customers this way .
as i ' m shopping every associate that i came across had a smile and said hello .
we ordered the bone marrow , chicken wings and poutine .
she finally have us our money back , and for some reason needed our email .
she calls our number and we all huddled around and was ready to go .
generous portion , good balance of topping vs . chips .
why would n't you want to help someone so that they come back ?
i first went in to this salon looking for an aveda product about a year ago .
i ' m sure everyone else has told you to get the jalapeno yellowtail sashimi and the miso cod .
i looked at her in disbelief confronted her that we were waiting first .
my cod was n't over breaded and the tartar sauce was pickle chunky .
the problem started when our food was delivered before the wine .
i did n't argue because i thought maybe i was wrong we ate .
worst decision of my life ! ! ! my ` ` stylist ' ' was joy .
i love the frank sinatra tunes , decor , and movies playing in the background .
today there were two associates helping one customer at the cutting table .
the music was a bit loud even after we asked the server to turn it down a bit .
this was not the case , the shop is fairly run down and dirty .
. the rice sure made it an asian nachos ... this was surprisingly tasty .
it has an adorable patio , and a <UNK> feel inside .
this place was so delicious and i ca n't wait to go back .
the onion bacon jam they serve with it is stringy which makes it hard to eat .
my friend and i are locals and wanted to find live music and we found this place .
as usual , the food is delicious and bursting at the seams with calories .
this tea was so delicous i drank three glasses of it in one sitting .
and do n't forget to get ice cream and a snow cap on your snow cone !
his help definitely made my experience at the restaurant even better .
the fries in the poutine were fresh and the gravy was delish .
their happy hour menu has many good deals as well .
great marinade and veggies but with one small piece of lobster in a <UNK> tortilla .
pizza was delicious and fresh , and quick delivery too !
very good ravioli omg was my fav i wish i had 0 orders to my self .
it was a bit busy , so we did n't get much attention .
there were two sinks in the bathroom , a tub and a standing shower .
my partner ordered the steak with caramelized onion , also tasty .
and do n't get me started on the kimchi soup .
we will definitely be back next time we ' re in vegas !
chef also brought us a rock shrimp lettuce wrap appetizer which was fantastic .
the menu had lots of cool looking fusion items on it , and i was so excited .
both were nice but i definitely would go back to cafe <UNK> .
the hostess and server was quick , friendly , attentive , and efficient .
it ' s tucked into a nondescript location on the second floor of a strip mall .
they had some great pieces and it was very retro .
it ' s intimate , yet fun to bring a small group of friends .
we will continue to eat at chop shop as often as we can !
the staff , unpleasant when they were n't ignoring us , must have been having a bad night .
the computer <UNK> how well you do so you can play for fun or actually compete .
dr . <UNK> is wonderful with our son and is very understanding and attentive to our needs .
i wish them the best , but i will not be returning .
they had to look up what i wanted and make several calls to make it happen .
i was very suspicious so i left and got on aaa and found lee ' s .
hits : fresh veggie <UNK> , red curry , pad thai , chicken wings .
we stopped in here for the lunch buffet and were pleasantly surprised .
loved her technique - - very fluid and had perfect pressure .
the deep cleaning of the blinds and fans and oh gosh just everything !
we also ordered the pretzels and it was fresh , warm and delicious !
i spoke with both the manager and general manager , but they were not interested in customer service .
as our day progressed we realized we would not make it by the reservation time .
watermelon salad - - light , fresh , zesty and with the perfect amount of feta cheese .
once you start you realize they ' re all going to be really good !
crust has been chewy and pizza tastes blah ... and pricey !
i have had the red tiramisu , and the <UNK> served in the big wine class .
my friend and i walked in a very crisp designed lobby .
i ' ve met some decent people here and had alright conversation , and also had the opposite experience .
i guess come before 0:00 ... great time with friends and food was good .
it ' s inexpensive and i ' ve always received unexpectedly good service .
so i was at <UNK> house brewery & this food truck was there .
i was a bit hesitant to have someone unknown cut and style my hair .
there was no way to pick the burrito up without slop seeping out .
my boss , who is about to run an iron man , finished the whole thing off ... .
way too much food for two of us and it was all out of this world .
yummy food for a great price , but i wished the service was faster .
if you ' re looking for anything <UNK> , do n't waste your time .
i told my server and she seemed apologetic - lrb - although she never actually expressed it - rrb - .
the menu was much more limited than i would have imagined .
i ' ve yet to find a cupcake place like the cupcakery here in southern california .
just bring your id , credit card , and phone !
the sauce they tell you to add made the dish so salty it was borderline unbearable .
also , we can set up an appointment online , as well .
discussed party options as well as cookie decorating and cookies for santa !
as a chicago resident , i thought i had eaten all the great pizza i would consume .
i suggest the garlic pesto ... yum ! ! the only complaint for the evening was the dessert .
we had private rooms , and it was nice and dark .
all portions are big , so you can share between two people .
i drop off my shoes to get extra grip put on my shoes , and my straps tightened .
i also had great service every time i have gone there .
read some good reviews for this place here on yelp and decided to give it a try .
the best part of my weekend was watching this show .
the flavors were bold and complex and i have a new favorite place .
if the service is n't exactly inspired , it ' s always very fast .
it was less than convenient , and i drink a lot of water .
i ' m really amazed that this place is getting such great reviews .
the panini which was supposed to be grilled and crispy was basically soggy and inedible ... .
also tried their butterfly fried fish - - which tasted amazing .
if you are a huge glutton for cheese , nando ' s is your paradise .
longer wait than a doctor ' s office just to return some equipment .
little friends pet sitting is the best thing we have ever done for our dogs !
came in for beer only and the menu is great !
i ' d rather drive 00 mins than deal with the ugly attitude there .
it has an amazing view of the strip that just really makes the energy outside fantastic .
i definitely recommend and if u can score the groupon even better .
this brings me to the macaroons , the only ones i have found beside bellagio that i love .
every time when i want some spicy szechuan style food , i go this place .
my parents always ask me to bring some with when i visit .
we told him what we liked and he just <UNK> up beautiful sushi and maki or us .
we love love love it and i will definitely be going back .
the gyro was amazing and the lentil soup was delicious !
the ikura was freaking awesome , fresh and perfect seasoned which is hard to find .
we were seated immediately and our waitress was helpful , very nice and extremely prompt .
no , she called our number once and that was it .
anyway , we ' ll definitely be back to this museum .
we ' ll definitely not be returning to this restaurant .
there were so many fine details to each entree ; ok , i ' m a sucker for presentation !
you ' re guaranteed to have fun when you eat here !
zucchini was really good , burgers were awesome but the onion <UNK> were just ok .
i ordered a bean burrito with jalapeã ± o fresco y <UNK> .
they looked at each other and the <UNK> came over to cut my fabric .
husband got a mixed drink with the rum , still good .
super flavorful , fried without being to greasy or burnt .
it ' s byob so i like that i can bring my own favorite wines too !
back i went for another round of <UNK> <UNK> today .
fresh , delicious , creamy , tart , sweet , amazing !
this all allowed me to enjoy the show that much more .
our server was nice , but not attentive at all .
i do n't know of anywhere else where they use hot stones in the foot massage .
the waiters would walk around but it took them forever to come ask us for our beverages .
i also applied the hair product she pressured me to buy .
from 0-0 , they have non and alcoholic drinks and cold / hot hors d'oeuvres serving .
the brie was melted , topped with caramelized onions , bacon and was cooked perfectly .
i love all the noodle dishes and the mango curry with beef is to die for !
and you will know when you taste it ! ! i often come here for taro boba .
we were promptly greeted , and given a menu to look at while we waited for a table .
even though we really did n't enjoy our food nearly enough , the staff was great .
drinks are great and the machines have been very nice to me !
service was very friendly , albeit a bit slow , especially as it got busier .
ok now that is done , this place is such a wonderful experience !
i do n't think so , trust me , it was not busy at all .
warning : the bathroom is crammed waaaay in the back of the restaurant .
you are a grocery store hidden place in the middle of oakland .
however , you can see that effort has gone into revamping it , and it ' s decent .
i bring a 0 yr old boy here almost once a week .
omg , been wanting to go here 0-0 months ago .
luckily i had a great time with my friends but the atmosphere was lacking , hard .
she was nice enough but it seems the entire store needs a lesson on customer service and speed .
he went out of his way to make sure i had a great experience with enterprise .
the seasoning was so good and the tomato sauce was hot and spicy .
the service was great , although the hostesses were dressed rather casually for the atmosphere of restaurant .
is walter a small , medium , or large dog ?
we had the sweetest lady for our server , so the service was excellent .
the equipment is frequently broken , despite complaints from the members .
we each enjoyed our tacos and the stuffed pepper was fab as well .
- lrb - totally understandable - - since they are n't use to such a large party - rrb - .
we enjoyed our dinner there and would recommend it for sure !
and to top it off the waiter was <UNK> cute .
it had a great amount of flavor but sort of just slipped off the dough .
the venue is huge and there is plenty room along the pools .
you ca n't really ask for a more luxurious experience .
i cane back to the table and drinks were already here .
for $ 00.00 i would expect the whole entire thing to cover my plate .
the food was great here , but the service was horrific .
even tho i did n't like my sub my boyfriend loved his .
but for 0-0 <UNK> , it ' s a wonderful place !
but i decided to give it another try , see if i ' ll change my mind .
we spent our 0 - yr anniversary here ... excellent service , tasty food .
just a heads up , the portions are huge so you will either be stuffed or not finish .
i agree w / other reviewers , getting stuck could suck up a lot of your time .
i was giving a ride to some out-of-town guests and we just needed a quick bite .
we tried their samples and some were alright , nothing really stood out though .
the entrance is a bit confusing as far as where you go to get sat , though .
we all had maybe a bite , and set them aside .
the kimchi - lrb - bland and sad - rrb - .
he went with the rib-eye - lrb - <UNK> <UNK> - rrb - ... and loved it !
there are about 0 screens that are movie theater size lost among 00 other smaller screens .
- rrb - so i waited outside , in my car .
i truly feel that her full attention is focused on me and my hair .
fried chick peas : my friend really liked them ... i thought they were only ok .
i ' ve also had the corned beef hash and eggs .
we came here for our ` ` splurge ' ' dinner in vegas .
it ' s a great place to take my son .
that next week bill brought 0 of his best men - lrb - to include himself & father - rrb - .
shannon developed and implemented a plan to sell our home and did just that in days ... days !
the chicken was sooo overdone , it was beyond dry .
so relaxing and refreshing i did n't want to leave .
' ' so now it ' s not a hazard or a security call .
i love books and libraries and am trying to also <UNK> that with my son .
i am waking up craving more right now , i ca n't wait to o back .
i ' m sure we will be back next year .
i think it would have tasted fine without the slaw or perhaps up the taste for the slaw .
i asked , ` ` because it must weight 000 lbs at the base !
i love love cuban food so i was thrilled that there was a place so close to me .
never again - lrb - for all of us - rrb -
i also got a side of plantains and they were yummy and <UNK> from the cooking process .
my boyfriend had the chicken katsu curry , and i had the chicken tenders .
the staff is nice , <UNK> that ' s it .
delicious ! ! ! i had the hangover burger which was so good and i could only eat half .
we sat at one of the teppan tables with two other families .
it was amazing ! ! pie snob has pies perfected !
if i ever am in down again i will definitely be coming back !
the only thing is i ' d suggest to not eat outside because the flies were quite annoying .
my daughter loved the pita bread and she ' s 0 .
if you want to splurge , add an neapolitan shake !
i ca n't say why , i was just expecting a different level than i experienced .
maybe i just had bad luck in my pasta picking .
how on earth is it the same if not more as a specialty drink .
they bring out parade faces that the birthday girl or boy <UNK> over their own head .
i think i was greeted at the window maybe once .
my favorite was the <UNK> it had so many flavors and textures that meld together into something amazing !
i have been to this location twice and absolutely loved it !
a friend and i arrived around 0:00 on a tuesday with no reservations and were seated right away .
we went here for our anniversary and it was perfect .
my parents were visiting and i decided to take them to fez .
i would recommend calling in advance ! ! however , i lucked out and there was a cancellation .
i have several new experiences to exchange for the initial impression .
this was my favorite meal of our las vegas trip .
it ' s a huge room full of different instruments that you can play .

my husband and i had our first date here in 0000 and have been coming here ever since !
for what ' s worth , i totally loved this place .
the teller expected me to say my husband ; s social security number out loud .
it ' s quiet and quaint , the service is good , and the food was tasty .
friendly service and the salad came out quickly and it was huge !
yummy flavor , but so much salt competing with it that it made my tummy hurt .
one horribly annoying thing was the amazingly loud table of what appeared to be japanese business men .
we literally feel like we are family when we come to this place !
this place really knows how to serve a full portion meal for a great price .
i ca n't say enough how much everyone working in the office was professional and kind .
the green chili pork that my sister had was also overly salted and the hamburger was nothing special .
next time i ' m in vegas , i will definitely come here .
i got an estimate and called them to start working out the details of my new deck .
whenever i am in town , my mom and i come here for dinner .
first , shitake mushrooms should be reserved for just a few dishes since they ' re so pungent .
she has taken care of my four legged family members multiple times .
i definitely enjoyed my hours here and would like to return next time i ' m in the area .
way more filling than i thought they would be for the size .
i only wish they had creme brã » lã © e .
instead of addressing our concern , we were at first ignored by him .
and there were several hangers still left that were next to the items that were stolen .
i ' m always surprised by how busy this place is given it ' s location .
this was 0 people , 0 appetizer , 0 entrã © es , 0 dessert and a bottle of wine .
wish we could be regulars so you could be our regular server !
did n't really want to go there , but thought i ' d give it another shot .
and if you ' re a fan of coffee you must come here on mondays after 0pm .
great seasoning and i did n't feel like they skimped out on anything .
` ` not even a loaner until my next paycheck ?
i ca n't say enough about how pleased i am with our photos .
it was more lemongrass tasting , did n't really taste the jalapeno .
maybe if my tits were like eight sizes bigger , but a girl can dream .
my friend kept saying ` ` i think he forgot our asparagus ' ' , but i had faith .
after five years , my favorite michael kors watch died .
we usually go when it ' s not too busy .
. i had it with a four peaks peach ale , which was also yummy .
i have been coming to place several times since my first visit and it still is absolutely wonderful .
stupid fries , waffles , chicken , corn bread , and mac and cheese today , perfect !
jerseys ... friendly , cheering and clapping as if you were in an actual stadium .
taco plate , one scoop rice and beans , expected more , though beans were really good .
the salsa portion was a small 0.0 ' ' ramekin or so .
and for their sides we had duck fried rice , wok sauteed vegetables and wasabi mashed potatoes .
<UNK> kitchen is way better and they are friendly without attitudes .
my son played every single instrument at least 0 times .
i have been going to him since then and have always had a great experience .
cafe aroma was a very pleasant place to kill time for a few hours .
the thai ice tea was the only item i just did not like at all .
supper yummy wraps that are just the right amount of food .
i would n't get the reg frosting again , but i ' ll be back !
i wish that they had this restaurant near my house it was so good !
the waiter was very nice and helpful with recommendations when we asked , but he was just swamped .
this was just a random stop for us before leaving back to <UNK> .
their house wine is twisted , which i personally felt was a good choice .
first , we ordered a calamari appetizer and a bottle of wine .
i felt completely at ease leaving my two doggies in their care .
great service and got some great quality shirts in assorted colors .
next time i will do another skillet for variety but i will stick to the protein pancakes .
we had the crackling calamari salad , the lime miso sauce went great with it .
this store is bright , clean , and conveniently located for me .
it sucks they have gone so downhill when they used to be so awesome .
service over the top , food out of this world good .
i mean , we finished the calamari and no sign of the wine .
i had the lunch soup / salad / half sandwich for $ 00 .
the price point was good and the employees were very friendly and helpful .
the crawfish ã © touffã © e was alright ... the consistency seemed a little thicker like japanese curry .
i ' ve bad a better steak at outback and it only fake with ... literally ... .
a lot of sushi places do this now , and i do n't really understand it .
strange but that ' s not stated on the menu .
i noticed it does n't matter which server i get .
some of the best sushi i ' ve ever had .
i am a person that loves their dogs like children .
i love their taco salads because their tacos are homemade and soooo delish .
thank you dr . <UNK> ! ! ! just another thing <UNK> dogs right !
there was a guy singing for the night , he was n't good whatsoever .
the opportunity to indulge finally came my way , and i jumped on it .
the ribs were so tender and falling off the bone , the beef brisket was good too .
i ended up ordering an spinach omelet which was good .
i got the kale and corn salad which i loved .
i ' ve been here 00 or 00 times and this was the worst .
i wo n't be taking my out of town guests , or anything .
so i write this review hoping next time to at least raise it up a star .
never apologized , did n't say anything about the crab cakes not coming out .
i ' m going with this is n't gon na last very long ... .
very mellow , a live and let live vibe through the night .
my soup was spectacular , and i practically licked the bowl .
expected full size foam container and got half for fries .
the wait on the food was n't too long either .
you feel like family when you walk into the restaurant .
so i had high hopes after seeing the pictures online and they continued on when i entered .
make sure to leave an espresso bean behind for luck !
however , the prawns and scallops were a hearty size and cooked very well .
all in all , it was like a cheap motel 0 .
it was completely renovated about 0-0 years ago after burning down so it ' s nice inside .
hopefully so , because i prefer it to any other thai restaurant in gilbert by a mile .
their sushi is always fresh , their portions are insane , and their daily specials are yummy .
we called and ordered ahead and our food was ready in ten minutes .
sign up for their <UNK> and you get a $ 00 half birthday coupon !
the mac and cheese is the best we ever had .
their butternut soup is out of this world , almost more of a dessert .
i looked to yelp which led me to pie snob .
i am still giving it a great review because the food was amazing , especially the banana bread .
my only complaint : take over the coffee place by my office , please .
do n't miss the bang bang shrimp appetizer ... it ' s a guaranteed crowd pleaser .
absolutely love the tomahawk porkchop ! ! ! sooo good !
the brunch on sunday with the bloody mary bar is ridiculously fun , awesome and delicious .
he immediately stops me and asks where did i get this bell trolley .
the pizza was n't bad , but nothing i would crave .
we ordered the wonton soup a couple of times but it was way too salty .
the menu was pretty neat looking and the food descriptions looked fun inside it so i had hope .
can we say the women here are rude as hell and i am talking about the <UNK> .
great crowd and food ... you ca n't go wrong !
it is a hidden gem , serving delicious , authentic jamaican cuisine .
after she had been <UNK> , <UNK> and touching the door and menus .

we just ordered some apps - the pakora and a small plate of <UNK> <UNK> were delicious .
dr . lam and his staff were so kind , considerate , and professional .
luckily my group mostly had cash but it would have been interesting if we did n't .
the food was good , and the employees were extremly nice and professional .
there are also varieties of cheeses and toppings that ensures everyone will leave happy .
my portion was way bigger than his , but i think his was oddly even more tender .
this place is so much fun with a live band !
because the girls and i are all <UNK> , we fell in love with the wine list .
love you , heath ! ! ! good <UNK> ' you tonight .
all were fabulous , the phoenix - lrb - cream cheese , fig , and proscuitto - rrb - was my favorite .
the eggs were cooked perfect and the kalua pig was flavored perfectly - lrb - not crazy salty - rrb - .
so our server approached and wanted to take a drink order .
if only the self check out machine would stop breaking down .
the pit roast was also really delicious , but just a little fatty for my taste .
not just one or two , but 000s mixed it with the <UNK> type jello salad .
the restaurant choices at this hotel are good and we always enjoy our stay .
kiddo had chicken fingers again and still <UNK> for a kid ' s entree .
worth every penny , even though i did n't shell out a dime .
the atmosphere was nice and the service was friendly and attentive .
other than that , it ' s the perfect place for a romantic splurge dinner in vegas .
they did a great job on my car and were pleasant to deal with .
my son and i came to try it from a groupon i bought .
you do n't have to go to a fancy restaurant to get 0 star service .
went here for brunch and had their salmon eggs benedict ... they were awesome !
this place is way overpriced for flavor profiles that are not executed properly , and lack balance .
however , 00 for brunch is not worth it ... at least not at a hipster bbq joint .
i ' ll reserve judgement though because they just recently opened .
the titanic was beautiful also and we see what happened with that .
stopped to pick up lunch for me and a friend and wow , $ 00 went far !
not gon na lie , i ' m totally broke now .
the eggplant parmesan had a good texture to it , but the tomato sauce base is lacking dimension .
my party of 0 ordered a lot of food and our server never forgot any of our orders .
will definitely return to euro pizza cafe when we are back at fountain park .
we always have great service here and will continue to come back again and again .
there was a long line at <UNK> but it moved fairly quickly .
the portion was quite large , enough for 0-0 meals for me .
lived here 00 years & never had the courage to enter the place until friends suggested meeting there .
if you changed your hours , why not change the sign on your door and update your website .
we all know it , it looks like most of us love it .
all of my belongings arrived safely and were placed in their new rooms quickly .
really ? it took a groomer over 0 hours to cut a dog ' s hair ?
the blackened beef was perfectly seasoned and stir-fried with red & green bell peppers and mushrooms .
we chose to share the warm spinach salad as an appetizer , and that was unforgettable .
scott is the man and the drinks are great ! ! ! music , <UNK> , and a <UNK> fan ! ! !
chipotle has been a long-time staple of my diet , and i have ventured to it , nationwide .
i will make sure to stay away next time with that one .

i got biscuits and gravy , awesome first bite but then a bit salty .
we use their service when we go out of town and we are just thrilled with it !
i greatly enjoy their boba milk teas , although way overpriced compared to other places .
so while other people may complain that the baristas are rude , i quite appreciate the honesty .
when you walk in it ' s like little tokyo .
she was very honest about food options and she was attentive .
the fans that come here are the <UNK> i have ever seen .
our waiter was garrett who was the perfect attentive funny and lively waiter .

i highly recommend shannon with morrison residential to anyone who is in the market to buy or sell .
. cooked to perfection - lrb - medium - rrb - , just how we like it !
i am not waiting for security - lrb - and to be treated like a flipping criminal !
the ambience was beautiful but the host and the clientele destroyed all beauty in this place .
they have great kids programs , activities and reading times .
my husband thought the flour tortillas were too buttery and meat seasoning was n't interesting .
i can only imagine what the rest of the staff was like .
. and the yummy bread ... we did n't have much room left !
` ` <UNK> ' ' is now something i wish every city had !
took my cat , mao , here for her first shots and to get chipped .
since moving to wisconsin , i have had a hard time finding food that is satisfying .
however , that ' s only a problem because of the huge <UNK> of really cool looking pool area .
the vet was very gentle with mao and she kept me in the loop with tests and procedures .
your people hate working for you and fear you and your nazi <UNK> !
i of course ordered a fare share of sweets and it was all absolutely delicious !
no matter what time we go , we always have breakfast .
it was hard to decide on flavors because they all looked so yummy !
maybe it ' s a <UNK> effect of the cute latte art .
chicken was n't dry and caesar dressing was pretty decent .
we saw it while we were driving and i said why not .
that was such a <UNK> move on their part which makes me hesitant to go back .
the rosemary bread that ' s placed in each table is super yummy too .
then it takes another 00-00 mins before the server asks for your order .
the macaroon was very nice and it was a reasonable price .
i highly recommend the 00 % roll & geisha roll had the freshest avocado incorporated into it .
all in all , this is a really good costco .
i love the decor and the staff are sweet and welcoming .
next time i think we ' ll try noca next door .
one word to describe the food , all of the food : salt .

i also enjoy how dr . b goes into great detail about the benefits of pet insurance .
i was marinated overnight fried to perfection and drizzled with honey .

logistics / price : it ' s open 00/0 , which is its best advantage .
no one knows all this is not my own hair .
my husband got some weird meat mix wan na be falafel thing that tasted like crap .
this will definitely be one of my go-to places whenever i visit vegas !
each fry had something on it which i appreciate , and was full of flavor .
however i really was n't a big fan of the miso <UNK> , uni cream sauce spaghetti .
since then i got nothing but a flood of emails asking us to stay at this hotel .
atmosphere is cozy and perfect for getting some work done or chatting with friends .
eat before you come cause if you have to eat gluten-free there are n't many options .
it was the worst food and such a waste of money .
there was so much cajun food to choose from ... from etoufee to crawfish .
hh consist of a good selection of $ 0 wines of all varietals or $ 00 bottles .
the chocolate mousse was the perfect size for how rich it was .
queso with the chips was the most edible thing but i would n't order it again .
was seated , given a 0 free muffins to share while we ordered .
what i love most about it was that it was separate from the guys .
what is nice is they are n't soggy or to thick .
appetizers - we were brought a large plate of assorted appetizers .
my most recent visit was a sunday night and the restaurant was very quiet .
i would def go back and reorder this same thing for dinner .
i ' ve heard great things about this place and when i was visiting arizona i had to try !
i discovered this place on yelp as part of my research for craft <UNK> restaurants near our hotel .
the place was fun , service as fast and if you like seafood its has huge portions .

i especially liked that you could order something you can share / snack on .
it has a very relaxing laid-back vibe that i love .

four stars because the service in the beginning was less than par .
i can get that at starbucks - lrb - along with burnt coffee , but that ' s another review - rrb - .

it was n't her fault , though , so i was n't upset with her .
i can experience the benefits of a yoga practice without feeling like i need to impress everyone .
the soup dishes were n't anything to rave about , but decent .
i brought the item in and it was packed carefully , <UNK> and quickly !
0 waitress in the lounge with about a handful of customers and they could n't get anything right .

their oxtail soup is perfect for <UNK> when you need an alternative to ramen or pho .
there was something for all interests - - visual , art , <UNK> , everything !

he ' s the same guy there every day except sunday working his hardest .
but i would never go back if celebrating a special event .
the best part about it is that it is made fresh everyday .
the hostess was unprofessional and kind of rude , but seated us immediately .
it ' s kitschy , and i think that ' s cute .
it took him a little over 0 hours to do my car and boy does it sparkle .
they offered a cheaper and more flexible way to size my squash blossom necklace .
let ' s just say we were less than impressed .
. ironically i ended up getting it faster than other visits .
he had told me to expect the team between 00 and 0 , and i had planned accordingly .
my boyfriend wanted to check this place out though so we proceeded inside .
i ' m not sure why it gets such a high score .
we ordered the famous dave ' s bread pudding at the end of our meal .
the mac ' n ' cheese was ooey gooey deliciousness ... and definitely not low cal .

i enjoy when people do not seem annoyed to be working !
my partner ate his whole sandwich , but was n't raving about it .

i really loved how this place was n't an insane wait and crowded like hot & juicy crawfish .
i ' ve mostly just stuck to their vegetarian dishes , love them all .
and when i questioned them they were rude and dismissive .
and i do n't mean <UNK> , but you know , adult .
on nice , warm day make sure to sit outside ... great place to people watch and relax .
i was kind of sad to learn it was a chain ... but i guess that ' s silly .
instead of a spicy , savory soup , all you taste is shitake mushrooms .

i ordered the dozen oysters , which smelled fishy once they laid the platter on the table .
we always order the rainbow & caterpillar rolls - both were great !

i have to admit first off that i ' m a little biased .
there were 0 kids under 00 yrs who needed a snack .
otherwise , service was friendly & quick , and we enjoyed our meal .
will look nice i think when complete , but they have materials left out everywhere .
to top it off , now i ' m feeling sick , hopefully it is n't the food .
upon entering the restaurant we were received a warm welcome and sat down very quickly .
tiger roll , crazy jalapeã ± os , and <UNK> ' s special are our faves .

i moved an entire apartment in it , no joke .
if you have the money to spend , do it .
after getting a big plate at the buffet , i noticed <UNK> in my food !
i am one happy camper with cold air blowing on me as i type !
and even after that he was n't around to refill drinks .
i had fried chicken with jalepeno waffles the last time i went and they were the best !
if i could give it 0 stars , i would .
i really enjoyed everything and being from nyc i really enjoyed finding some great pasta here on vegas
then we ordered the ` ` meat and potatoes for two ' ' .
friendly people and good seating area to lounge in in the back .
i was n't playing much but i hit a few times and not bad for a <UNK> .
i ' ve never had an issue here ... but maybe it ' s cuz my stylist is <UNK> .
she was the best host i ' ve ever had at a table .
then we each had a bruschetta plate and shared - - the manhattan , the <UNK> and the phoenix .
they have the <UNK> options , but i like them , and the are so much cheaper .
for entree , we shared a mediterranean pizza - - yum !
i come from a family filled with <UNK> who all have a weakness for sweets .
the price is a bit steep but well worth treating yourself .
- rrb - i ordered their kalua pig benedict - - omg it ' s so damn good .
italian was the only thing we all agreed on , so off we went .
after a couple bites it was just to sugary , and i was bored .
then said , ` ` it might fall over on you .
my burger of the week was delicious , with a spicy sauce on it and perfectly cooked .
my problem is that the bagels i ' ve purchased have been very hit or miss .
the music and orderly service really help prepare my heart for worship .
after waiting five minutes , one stopped consulting and decided to stack fabrics as i waited .
also had their michelada - lrb - bloody beer - rrb - - - a definite must !
they soak your feet in hot water while they work on your head and shoulders .
it ' s a beautiful hotel but honey it ' s more to a place then looks .
they failed to tell me this when i originally called and asked .
so basically this place rocks , and it is found on the second level of the container park .
next the entree , i ordered veal parm , which was decent but nothing spectacular .
he did this without asking if we would like another dish instead .
i ' ve always had reasonably fast and friendly service , and my drink is never , ever empty .
the hostess was very nice , got someone to come by about 0 min later .
i think they rushed to open a store with the new vaping craze going on .
i must say , we ate so much i think the store will go bankrupt !
i thought that the all the servers were so cute , especially the older lady .
the servers are cussing in front of the customers and being very unprofessional .
we went later in the evening and 0 of the 0 cocktails were already sold out .
he always checked in on us to see if we ' re doing good .
everyone went overboard to get me that exact vehicle i wanted .
the food is wonderful , but beyond that , they are incredibly kind people .
i hate to say it but this was a bit of a disappointment .
i find random cool stuff hear like maple water and <UNK> green tea .
we did n't have to wait long for our drinks .
some of the best soul food i have had in a very long time .
to add to the injury , my salmon looks old or like it was left out ... .
i ordered the fish and chips and it was really good .
