how would i ever choose ?
i ' ve definitely had better .
i only went in for their macaroons .
friendly staff and clean store .
we both ordered the <UNK> four course meal .
most hospitable and attentive service <UNK> !
it ' s not the real thai food .
i honestly can not recommend them enough .
yum ! ! ladies bathroom disgusting .
first of all , the concept was brilliant .
i ' ll probably be back !
the staff was very friendly , and helpful .
this was what the concierge lounge was all about .
for airport food , i really was n't disappointed .
the staff was fabulous !
the slowest service ever in charlotte !
they dont have a restroom .
i will be back !
all our dishes showed up as ordered .
theyre also now called preferred cleaners .

both their big <UNK> and mini <UNK> are disappointing .
unfortunately , this place was a big letdown .
i love this place great atmosphere .
she was always kind and knowledgeable .
the foods always wonderful .

the <UNK> were very good !
it was okay , but not spectacular .
i love <UNK> library .

great people working there !
i just want to vomit .
<UNK> ' up the brownie points .
i recommend her to everyone .
they are the best .
i think it ' s a pretty balanced cupcake .
the best falafel of my life .
it ' s literally a 00-00 person seating area .
the pickles that came with it were great though .
another perk is how much later their hh goes .
- lrb - at least not yet .
so glad i called <UNK> .
i was <UNK> optimistic and gently dropped .
what i did not love was the lobster taco .
thrilling , i know .
friendly staff and delicious food !
the grade at the location is 00 health inspection .
the <UNK> shots are n't half bad here too !
the food was a bit <UNK> for me .
i really wish bands would stop doing shows here .
he also checked the bathtub area .
i wanted to come here and see for myself .
i could feel my teeth breaking into each layer .
great food , good service , wonderful over-all experience !
employees are not as friendly as the other group .
people holding vip tickets ended up going first .
it was just all too much for me .
will definitely be back .
he finished with strawberry mochi .
they had endless options for food .
mom had a fish sandwich and fries .
what an awesome experience .
save yourself some time and do n't move here .
i even went back and ordered the <UNK> .
do i look like her now ?
ab fab and totally <UNK> idea !
totally freakin ' awesome .
they were ok , but andy is the best .
made me utterly sick .
i also ordered the curry <UNK> .
egg rolls were disgusting .
i wish i could have taken a picture .
our server <UNK> rocks !
very disappointed by their treatment and disregard for customers .
not a big place so make reservations .
we love the apple roll !
these tasted like cardboard .
the complex itself had countless more !
all the dishes were very flavorful .
i ' d bet she did n't inform management .
that ' s where we are happiest anyway .
the atmosphere is beautiful and relaxing .
way to much money for poorly executed rolls .
: - lrb - conference room : comfortable .
thank you planet hollywood !
i got lost coming back from the bathroom .
friendly service and decent portions !
the staff was really friendly also .
the concierge greeted us .
it was protein heaven !
we loved the ribs and fried chicken !
he just stood there and kept yelling .
we ' re adults here .

this is a must try !
their fried oysters were crispy and plump .
our waitress was nice .
we were treated like queens .
i will definitely be using him in the future !

portion size was perfect .
i love their wall of old school tapes .
it was very strange .
great smoothies and lunch food !
the cheese wontons are all pork .
all three were delicious .
overall , i enjoyed my meal at this restaurant .
i would recommend going somewhere else !
we come here exclusively for these ribeye tacos !
first , the service was great and attentive .
my son just participated in their summer reading program .
again the portion was itty bitty .
when i ate it , that confirmed my fear .
very filling and satisfying .
i ' m always greeted very kindly and thanked .
extremely poor customer service .
it definitely exceeded my expectations !
he is now part of our family .

the stir fried hollow vegetables were cooked perfectly !
the cake bites are delicious !
outstanding customer service at it ' s best .

they went above and beyond for me !
we had to sleep in a double bed .

two words to describe everything : fresh and delicious !
this struck me as sketchy .
it ' s all bread .
my fried chicken was delicious .
not far from airport and very easy to find .
used to be a fan .
that ' s exactly what we got !
all of their bread is delicious here .
we received everything fast without any issues .

the owner <UNK> is so nice .
nice to see smaller family owned bookstores around still !
the <UNK> men soup was spicy and delicious !
not like i participate or anything .
the cioppino was not what i recalled .
the service is also awesome .
all he wanted to do was intimidate me .
the flavor profile lacked depth .
in one word ` ` ehh .
tao beach is nothing special for vegas .
the location of this hotel is fabulous .
the poutine was delicious !
both gentlemen were very knowledgeable and very personable .
either get better staff or throw in the towel
bernie and jeremy are my go-to guys !
what i love most was the service here .
maybe only dinner , but <UNK> !
i loved the old school ice cream parlor look .
i ' ve had no problems with this office .

until then ... was it good ?

our server was robert .
the food was interesting .
i believe we were drooling over the plates .
i mean , there was almost a <UNK> .

you must go support this local small business !
the maui burger , great !
it was the worst grooming service ever !

but he said nothing .
and the rice was delicious !

we ' re always pleased with the friendly staff .

their employees are friendly and knowledgeable .

a decent selection of food and sushi .

it just melt in your mouth .
i need the recipe asap !
however they made it up to me .

this church had become my favorite event each week .
not a detail was missed .
i ordered the rib eye , medium .
will be coming back !
the food was good but the service was terrible .
fusion specialty bento box !
after that everything was good but not crave worthy .
it was n't all bad , though .
delivery time is fast also .
the fries were soggy .
their sandwiches are delicious too !
i immediately asked to speak to the manager .
it is two stories and is a bar .
. you guessed it !
went to eat here for a friends birthday .
complaint # 0 : my caesar salad .
it ' s fluffy pancake goodness .
i really enjoyed the ricotta <UNK> and burrata .
the service is friendly and quick .
i got about 00 pieces for 00 dollars .
` ` it ' s that .
. downtown mesa needs to get its props .
the beans were crunchy and flavorful .
i definitely will go back !
the dirty could have been more dirty .
it was a fantastic ambiance and service .
soap and amenities are nice , not fabulous .
great service and delicious !
the people on his team were equally wonderful .
she could n't even finish half of her order .
this is not it .
meh , not great .
place was not very clean , nor inviting .
i have never had such bad customer service !
although their dessert was absolutely delectable and huge .
really generous portion for kids meal .
the fish tacos were generously portioned for the price point .
when i saw the fact that this show <UNK> water it peaked my interest !
got my first root canal and i am so glad i came here !
for sushi , their ika was good and their sake - lrb - salmon - rrb - was pretty darn fresh tasting .
needless to say they did n't like when we started a u of a <UNK> ; - rrb -
of course i just got voicemail and 0 days later no one called back .
they should focus less on being trendy and hard to find and more on making amazing sushi .
when i came there , they told me that my order will not be ready til 0 pm .
listen to the waiter he knows what he is talking about
i know , most food is delicious late at night at the bar ... but , for real .
best price i could find in town for iphone 0 screen replacement !
i had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while .
i will try the cream cheese frosting next time and will probably get it from now on .
its the day before my coworkers birthdays when i realize i need to get a pie .
they made sure my boyfriend always had a drink in his hand .
it ' s got a crispy outer shell and soft <UNK> inside .
the bakery offers a lot of goodies and yummy sweets and really good gifts .
i got their full size ham , salami , cheese sandwich on their homemade baguette .
i paid $ 00 for someone to help lotion me up ... that ' s it .
he says no can do but that we are in luck .
ask for water in a kids cup , took them 00min or so .
we spent a beautiful sunday afternoon at rattlesnake cove at <UNK> lake .
however that did n't matter as we all ordered off the mixologist .
overall , great room and even better when it ' s the concierge lounge .
the drinks were yummy and they even let us sit down without ordering bottle service .
the lettuce was nasty - - bitter , hardly any leaf , just nasty .
reminds me of a place back home ... we will be back .
we came here looking for s center stone for my wedding ring .
soooo many flavors and loved ones i never thought i would ever like .
i ' ll go here again but only strictly for sushi .
then when i went to pay with a coupon that included a free meal .
it was served with lima beans , greens , bread crumbs & parmesan in some light olive oil .
their flavors are so fun and unique like rose scented raspberry , or black current tea .
i have been back several times in the past year .
it was super reasonable in price like 00 dollars and very fresh and plated thoughtfully .
my boyfriend and i got dressed up for the night and wanted to go somewhere fancy .
i am so grateful for all she does to make my life <UNK> .
it reminded me so much of the coffee scene in new zealand .
usually i ca n't tell food is salty just from smelling it .
i wished they had their steamed <UNK> like their closed location .
- lrb - - ___ - # - rrb - i love food stands and this is a must try place .
second was crab cake for me and saw bass for my husband .
my fiancã © took me to see the david copperfield show and we loved it !
they have a lot of interesting foods on the menu so i might go back again .
the only good thing the manager did was offer to pay our bill .
i wish i could tell you that this <UNK> has been helpful to my <UNK> .
we cut close 00 % of it off because of all the fat .
loved their homemade , pickled <UNK> and <UNK> - lrb - radishes - rrb - .
they were beyond friendly on the phone and very knowledgeable .
clean room and bathroom which is a must for me !
to start , when we walked in there was a foul smell in the lobby area .
it was awsome ! ! ! food : 0 stars !
been with this office for a couple years now and everytime feel this same frustration .
i ordered two rolls where the spicy tuna was ground up .
sat at the bar with my friend and the bartenders / sushi chefs kept us entertained .
they dont have toppings , <UNK> , chocolate shells , sprinkles , for toppings .
not too salty and the beef was not over cooked .
he took one look at the <UNK> and started to laugh .
i was meeting friends there for a brunch / networking thing , it was four of us all together 0 .
i ordered the classic and i was more than pleased .
do n't get me wrong , the food was n't bad but it was n't spectacular .
as we were eating our main courses , a basket of bread with some olive oil arrived .
the boyfriend had a rib eye and was quite impressed !
we ' ve tried a few different places and this is the best so far .
i had a medium caramel gelato , which was <UNK> tasty .
you are definitely paying for the atmosphere , which is great so makes it worth it .
i like the idea of eating <UNK> food in a <UNK> / comfortable environment .
my husband order the new york steak , which came with really yummy bok choy & asparagus .
i was looking forward to this place , and it was a complete let-down .
he stopped at nothing to make sure we got out of there with what we needed .
i asked , ` ` ca n't she help me ?
another guest had the duck , which was my second choice .
the green beans were seriously the best i ' ve ever had with the perfect amount of batter .
even tho the parents should really be the ones telling the kids to behave .
the staff is nothing short of spectacular and accommodating : they get 0 stars .
even when there are n't many people in the restaurant .
but then i got distracted by the next round of food !
i had no idea where to start , so i asked my friend for a recommendation .
i will definitely be back to this cute little cafe !
i had something called a <UNK> , a spicy blood orange and jalapeã ± o infused martini , very yummy .
the guy that was slicing meat was extremely helpful and joyful .
i work in cross <UNK> and have passed la <UNK> many times .
- lrb - we shopped in the meantime , because there were ample shopping choices nearby .
loved the spicey basil chicken it had a good balance of flavors and texture .
the cashier , anthony , is so kind and welcoming .
there was also some delicious bread as an intro plate , and pistachios , very fresh .
warning , once you have one , it ' ll be really hard to stay away !
i wish there was more locations , since i love north scottsdale and closer to me .
the casino was ok , waitress was rude and never brought my drink .
do n't forget accompany your meal with a glass of sweet tea !
it was just the right amount of sweetness and felt like it melted in my mouth .
it did not give the kind of ambience that so many restaurants in la give .
i had their fish tacos , which was pretty good .
got my food well after everyone else at my table .
we dined at the bar - - the bartender , jordan , was attentive and friendly .
i wish they had some type of caddy to take it all to your table .
but as far as dives go , it ' s awesome !
but i was n't able to pick her up after 0pm !
the food was good , but i prefer meat & potatoes fried chicken and jalepeno waffles .
compared to many artisan shops , the prices are actually very reasonable .
mm - - mmm ... fall-off-the-bone , savory , and sweet .
i could feel the heat coming through the wall i was sitting next to .
bakeries in the area were going to charge me twice as much for the same cake .
we are gold members so we utilized the free wifi .
i saw a coupon on <UNK> on yelp for the weekly pass and picked it up right away .
as for the soup it tasted like water with tons of salt in it .
the owners is are very accommodating , and smiling every time i see them .
not only is the ice cream mediocre , the staff at this location are super rude .
the first couple of times i got it , but it really started to get annoying .
now to the food : some dishes are really delicious .
great seats , fresh popcorn and they serve beer and wine .
i think our total tab was around $ 00 for 0 of us and my son .
