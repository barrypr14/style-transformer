__label__positive l love them

__label__positive evo duo for ipod classic is great . it was easy to put on the ipod classic and fits really well . allows full access to the click wheel .

__label__positive very cute . i laminated them and hung them on the wall in my classroom .

__label__positive rather than buy a few at a time in the stores i chose to buy a box of these . they are well made and should last me a long time .

__label__positive this printer was all we expected . help from hp has been great . would order it again and refer it to others .

__label__positive very good quality . great to use for many items . will continue to purchase this item . all mohawk products i have purchased so far are quality and affordable .

__label__positive works for what i need it to do . i am sure this box will last me a lifetime .

__label__positive just exactly the size i needed above my desk .enough space to pin up a post card and a few business cards .

__label__positive thanks !

__label__positive these pens write really nice . they were good for the price and actually have a cool camo notepad look . i really recommend them .

__label__positive works great and good value . the color is true and does not dry out like my epson did . i would buy this again .

__label__positive writes well

__label__positive we are so happy to have our cordless phones working again . these batteries were a good bargain . i shopped around first .

__label__positive very good

__label__positive i had a older sheaffer fountain pen which i loved but the filler piston had become ineffective . this new piston worked perfectly with the older pen !

__label__positive used one of these pencils that belonged to someone else and got the name to order one for myself . perfect pencil . love the extra erasers and leads that can be refilled .

__label__positive perfect if you love this breed . pictures are great really a quality calendar featuring the best smartest dog breed the world barley recognizes .

__label__positive i love this little machine . it is just what i was looking for .

__label__positive works well . sound could be clearer . but i am old .

__label__positive best price per quanty . fast delivery .

__label__positive great product ! recommended . good quality and design .

__label__positive i wanted something that would not scream a message . we put it in a visible spot so it is very effective and not obnoxious .

__label__positive it works ! i put my badge in it and it blocks my badge from being read by the reader .

__label__positive exactly what i wanted

__label__positive i used these on a couple of my older canon printers that are way out of warranty and they are working as well as the factory cartridges at a much better price .

__label__positive works ok

__label__positive it would be nice if the pockets were expandable as it is difficult to keep all statements for a month in the pocket .

__label__positive item just as described shipped promptly good seller !!

__label__positive they are small and make it easy to write on my small calendar . most of the colors are not very dark and are slightly hard to read .

__label__positive has worked well in my vehicle and protects the screen . it is been on for over a year with no bubbles or issues

__label__positive great phones . would highly recommend

__label__positive works great and love that i save so much money !

__label__positive arrived as stated . thanks .

__label__positive i purchased replacement battery s for my home phones and was pleased on the quality and price cannot beat the price .

__label__positive this is quite a bargain w authentic samsung color toners full capacity each individually wrapped . significantly cheaper than staples office depot or frys who only offer individual toners .

__label__positive does the job fine . keeps your sponge off to the side and helps it dry out . its inexpensive and effective .

__label__positive i ordered this for my husband s store he loved it ! now this paperwork is better organized .

__label__positive prints great

__label__positive worked great on my phone

__label__positive i took this to work because i have taken out so many staples from past medical records . it is great for up to pages and much easier to take apart .

__label__positive it was ok .

__label__positive product was as described and was delivered on time as specified what more can be said . i am happy !!

__label__positive it is always a good thing to acknowledge people for going out of their way . a good card to do so .

__label__positive nice and thick for copics spectrum noirs watercoloring ...anything you wish . much more economical to purchase the ream than a few sheets here and there !

__label__positive it is nice and i like it do not hesitate to buy it  .

__label__positive these sheets work really well with an ink jet printer . they are also easy to cut with scissors so you can cut out what you print .

__label__positive now i can leave my buiosness card on my desk and do not have to get them out of the box anymore .

__label__positive not exciting . answering machine audio is garbled and weak . handset menus hard to follow limited versatility . as a basic phone with no features it would be ok only .

__label__positive this was a gift for someone to go with the pens set that we also purchased . it arrived on time and was decently packaged .

__label__positive i am very happy with this shredder . it is a lot quieter than my old shredder and the removable collection box make clean up a lot easier .

__label__positive i had to purchase a new printer . i was not sure if i would like going from the cartridges back to the two but so far i really like the printer .

__label__positive this is a great product that works and sound very good but it seems to be too high priced for what it offers .

__label__positive just replaced the old batteries with these new ones and for the price i hope they last over a year

__label__positive great gifts .

__label__positive cross ballpoints feel good in the hand they write smoothly and take a long time to run out of ink .

__label__positive as expected

__label__positive i have run about sets of ink through my printer and it is as good as factory ink in my opinion .

__label__positive these are great brushes . i needed something to clean bottles and this gives me a variety of shapes and sizes which is what i needed .

__label__positive fast delivery and product is exactly what i expected .

__label__positive excellent

__label__positive solid . love the heavyness of this to not move when you pull a note out .

__label__positive i love the pen .

__label__positive these worked exactly as we expected . they feed in the printer well . you cannot just use regular index cards unless you wan to have wasted space a the margins .

__label__positive good price

__label__positive it was just what i needed ! less expensive than going to the store and the photo paper was a nice bonus !

__label__positive arrived on time and product is as expected . thank you !

__label__positive great product . excellent . quality made for a perfect gift .

__label__positive in the last years i have purchased over of the bobric b soap dispensers for use in restrooms in various buildings i have never had a problem with them .

__label__positive working real good i will deal with this company again .

__label__positive i replaced and older model of the same number . perfect . easy to install . directions are easily followed . out of the box and ready .

__label__positive this officejet is everything one needs to have a business . prints great pictures using photo paper . fast shipping would buy again .

__label__positive we have always had good photos using hp photo paper regardless of the type of printer we use . we are currently using the photo paper with a brother printer .

__label__positive my grandson loves these muppet dolls and goes to sleep with them every night ! he loves them !!!

__label__positive excellent

__label__positive very timely delivery and excellent performance . i am very happy .

__label__negative worked about a month then died

__label__negative the phone did not work . no dial tone . not worth the cost to return .

__label__negative not laminated and no reinforced holes for hanging . will be returning .

__label__negative cartridge was over filled black smears on paper every time i tried to use it . refund was quick though .

__label__negative returned it hard to open and get it into place a bit flimsy would not purchase again based on how hard it was to set up and take down .

__label__negative uneven wobbles discolored ... do not feel like returning

__label__negative nice quality . happy with the item

__label__negative did not work ....period .

__label__negative do not stretch for jr high books  ..was a fail

__label__negative not genuine lexmark ink . when i used it my print quality deteriorated . lexmark technical support advised use of the product voided my warranty and precluded them from offering any assistance .

__label__negative the batch i had exploded all over when i tried to use them and i did follow the instructions . i ended up returning them for a less messy alternative .

__label__negative very cheaply made . doubt they will last through the year .

__label__negative these just did not hold together  ... many broke before using and many broke very soon !!

__label__negative it is ok but considering the price plus shipping is expensive for what you get . it is not worth  .  . it is not so big and the quality is just ok .

__label__negative did not recieve a sharpener . just blades .

__label__negative this did not work . unable to hear or make a call when this was attached . waste of money buying this .

__label__negative was not a prepaid refill card as shown  . it was a gift card not the same thing .

__label__negative did not fit into my holder .

__label__negative it is a piece of trash  !!!!!

__label__negative adequate .

__label__negative i thought i was buying cases of for  . per case . this is a very cheap product and not worth  . per individual box .

__label__negative basic cordless phone . screen hard to read and it does not show how many missed calls in caller id

__label__negative once the first lead runs out it is trash because the next one will not come out no matter what . and refills will not go in . bad design and waste of money .

__label__negative quality reflected by he price . placard on top where it says man cave is not attached and it is pretty thin . but het it is a nice gift for the basement

__label__negative we ordered about of these and of them had slits in them in various places when they arrived and are unusable . very disappointing !

__label__negative thought it would be better quality just looks like someone printed it from home

__label__negative it is nice works well . does hat it advertises

__label__negative very thin will choose a thicker product the next time .

__label__negative rhinestones fell off after about weeks

__label__negative low pressure air ..then they die .

__label__negative terrible product . total scam . do not purchase

__label__negative sometimes cover does not put ipad to sleep

__label__negative i did not receive what is pictured . i received yellow and pink .

__label__negative failed to be delivered as promised ... disappointed on that .

__label__negative i am a little disappointed in these phones . the battery in one has already gotten very weak and only provides a very short talk time before it starts beeping .

__label__negative so disappointed the pen was in its box but fell off the seat of my car on the pavement and broke before i even had a chance to try it out .

__label__negative staples were fine . good quality . just too wide for my swingline deluxe heavy duty stapler .

__label__negative it appears big on the website but it is actually tiny

__label__negative have not used color cartridges yet but black is light grey . won t be able to use for anything outside of home use . not good enough for document printing resume etc .

__label__negative very flimsy placed in binder and half of them cracked at rings had to reinforce and tape . will not buy again .

__label__negative the picture is so dark . other than the pis it is mostly black . i would not recommend .

__label__negative product keeps rolling up . does not stay flat on surface .

__label__negative the letters i received are not inches . they are about inches . disappointed because i needed larger letters for a larger bulletin board !

__label__negative we lost our other one . then the day this one arrived we found the other one . far to lazy to send this one back . have since misplaced this one .

__label__negative had to send back . no monthly tabs or calendar before each month . who makes a planner without those ??

__label__negative cheaply made . runs out of ink quick .

__label__negative my lexmark print quality deteriorated after installing . i called lexmark technical support and they advised that the ink was not genuine lexmark thereby voiding the warranty and preventing them from providing any assistance .

__label__negative my brother printer does not detect these cartridges ...need to return .

__label__negative great !!!

__label__negative cheap vinyl like feel . not worth a quarter of the price paid .

__label__negative i understand their concept as to why they print their logo on the paper but even when inked it appears through . not a fan and prefer identical papers that lack this feature 

__label__negative was not the one shown in the pic

__label__negative cheap phone cannot hear out of it very well and not a good range .

__label__negative great quality bad design . once you get the case a little more than half way full it will not shut . i guess you get what you pay for .

__label__negative i liked the idea but the fox head was separate from the pom . hung strange on my bag that way ...

__label__negative it has a small dent in the pen ...

__label__negative so far one has not worked waiting to see if the others do .

__label__negative the roll was punctured and damaged ...had to dump nearly ft ....

__label__negative a little bigger than i thought it would be but still fits in my scrubs pockets .

__label__negative does not work !!! wanted all my money back and they ignored me !!

__label__negative came with a stain !

__label__negative very bad quality .

__label__negative this did not have a crisp enough image to satisfy me the pervious paper i had used was light years better . this is not suitable for crafts as it fades quickly and curls

__label__negative did not do the job

__label__negative for the december page it was an upside down september repeat .

__label__negative they are smaller than i expected .

__label__negative good feel and very nice looking fountain pen . however it leaks a lot ... this pen stained of my pants and one of my shirts .

__label__negative two of the cartridges were completely unusable .

__label__negative outdated ink does not work

__label__negative does not work

__label__negative first one out of the bag broke . i pulled the red one out and snap ! plastic broke on the inside .

__label__negative way too flimsy unless that is what you need . they have one that is better i am exchanging and getting those .

__label__negative wrong size for our unit even though it is listed on the pkg

__label__negative not legit .

__label__negative horrible ! i bought this as a backup and could never get it to work . completely useless waste of money and materials .

__label__negative these markets are absolutely terrible . they do not even show up on my dry erase board .

__label__negative as a year accountant it is the worst adding machine i have ever used . too many strokes needed for a basic calculation .

__label__negative is not white . when making corrections fluid is off yellow . threw it away . when i copied error stood out terribly .

__label__negative this is not the best but it is doable for those who are you taking things just for themselves . pieces fall apart and it is not starting

__label__negative thinner than i expected

__label__negative how about a  . star ? to get the paper to unwrap the tip i had to pull it down like layers . at that rate the will go fast .

__label__negative very small . does not insulate well

__label__negative my son seems to like them .

__label__negative terrible . box open . pieces fell out . not usable .

__label__negative too complicated but it is a landline so the price was okay .

__label__negative the zipper broke the first day of school cheaply made obviously

__label__negative overpriced !

__label__negative it did not last long it breaks .

__label__negative item arrived with scratches and dings on the base plate .

__label__negative suck . dried out in less than a day . spend the money for the brand name ones .

__label__negative took over a month to receive . light weight and feels cheap

__label__negative do not buy . leaked inside and destroyed my printer . i literally had ink leaking out of my printer . horrible save yourself the headache and do not buy this junk .

__label__negative does not accommodate page protectors which it why i got it . otherwise great little binder just disappointed that it is not wider to allow for page protectors and tab dividers .

__label__negative i m sorry that not the same who i want .

__label__negative i learned to my chagrin that this refill is too small in length . mine takes the pelikan 

__label__negative poor quality for the price .

__label__negative ok but expensive

__label__negative very dissatisfied ! very cheap looking and the material was wrinkled . i sent b it back !

__label__negative do not buy this for any reason

__label__negative cheap and small . get what you pay for .

__label__negative not one of these have worked and i am on my th .....not red ink will come out ....prints in blues and yellows if you are lucky 

__label__negative i guess i do not know what i was expecting but for half the price you can grab a smaller notebook with pocket dividers write list at the top of each page .

__label__negative i am not crazy about this product . it does not always work and there is really no way to fix it .

__label__negative ink got all over my hands will not buy again

__label__negative color is not at all like what is shown in photo . they are bland colors not bold or neon as described .

__label__negative works fine for the phone

__label__negative did not fit my cross pen

__label__negative product did not hold up to expectations !!!!!

__label__negative coloring is more yellow . very fake looking

__label__negative hard to assemble and just not a good product

__label__negative not a good product .

__label__negative did not work on my xp  ! had to return

__label__negative broke easily ...

__label__negative i have ordered newest version but of them are old grey version

__label__negative i thought they are like nice vintage look newspapers that i can use as wrapping paper but it was nothing like that . many colors and many advertisement of shoes and food . yuck .

__label__negative hard to sharpen pencils . the sharpener is one sided so colored pencils tend to get smashed on one side .

__label__negative smaller than i expected

__label__negative not please with this at all does not work .

__label__negative this gaff tape does not leave and residue which is cool but it also does not stick very well . it is pretty weak .

__label__negative do not buy poor quality .the zipper is defective .

__label__negative it is a battery . it worked .

__label__negative a little too thin

__label__negative not compatible .

__label__negative forgot how awful old xp games are .

__label__negative product came with dents on the board and the marker was dried out cracked .

__label__negative leaked toner into machine . stripes on copies run through feeder . terrible . i have learned my lesson and will buy brother oem toner .

__label__negative was not what i wanted

__label__negative your quickie did not do anything for me ! the springs just popped out and all the fluid leaked out too quickly ! bad design !

__label__negative not an exact replacement . works ok on non photo type material . on photo paper pictures are washed out . get the original cartridge for best photo printing .

__label__negative i do not like the quality or the fact that there are no tabs identifying each month separately . so i have order a hard back version .

__label__negative stopped using this because the grip part is super uncomfortable .

__label__negative the staple does not punch tight enough ...

__label__negative absolute garbage calendar . came extremely poorly packaged and is super thin paper

__label__negative it does not come with everything shown

__label__negative ink ran out and was skipping lines right away

__label__negative can barely hear playback beware this phone

__label__negative  plus dollars and i only got one design !!!! do not waste your money !!!!!!!

__label__negative i bought this hoping to use it as my new planner but the ink bleeds through and now my journal looks messy .

__label__negative did not fit

__label__negative i like the case but it can use some improvements on the kickstand . it is a bit difficult to open the kickstand .

__label__negative good product

__label__negative i bought this and after weeks they all broke not good . i will not buy it again .

__label__negative it did not come with any lead so i guess i am supposed to buy the pencil on line then run down to the store and buy some lead ?

__label__negative junk just cardboard box buy a plain box save 

__label__negative so far good . it sometimes stops in the middle of printing and then continues to print

__label__negative not worth the money .

__label__negative not nearly powerful enough and does not shoot very straight .

__label__negative pen part pushes back into cylinder

__label__negative too expensive . better deal at staples

__label__negative this product does not fit mfc j dw

__label__negative does not charge my electronics when plugged into the car .

__label__negative paper shedder no longer works .

__label__negative i like it

__label__negative too tiny regular pencils will not fit will have to wait til they are used or find an alternate use ... too bad as they are cute 

__label__negative great cover and play on the famous phrase . interior a bit of a let down .

__label__negative broken into pieces when received

__label__negative poorly balanced . leaky and irregular ink flow .

__label__negative just installed toner cartridge . seem operational .

__label__negative does not work .

__label__negative does not stick very well in colder temperatures .

__label__negative poor quality materials .

__label__negative pretty design nib troubles

__label__negative my printer started having problems with the print head after i installed this ink . i did read warnings about this happening though so i guess it is my own fault

__label__negative sort of works at first . then just throw this crap away and buy the real cartidges .

__label__negative it did not work at all it did reproduce images that represented the slide but they absolutely very low quality

__label__negative cheap pens but super cute

__label__negative wow the pen broke and we tried to have mont blanc repair it and they told us it was counterfeit ! i hope someone stands behind this purchase !

__label__negative i bought a refurbished unit to manage my documents ... i broke after two months of light usage . guess next time i am buying a new one .

__label__negative not as good quality as i expected but i will use them .

__label__negative flimsy

__label__negative highly disappointed with my order half of the pens i received are broken .

__label__negative do not buy . not working after a month . not recommend .

__label__negative very thin will choose a more durable envelope in the future .

__label__negative gel highlighters are the worst . you cannot get the accurate width in highlighting and they functions like wax crayons leaving tiny gel stuff all over .

__label__negative works as should

__label__negative looks almost the same as the picture but badly made .

__label__negative did not have remoistened flaps

__label__negative i have not been able to punch the sheets as advertised . i am lucky to get or in without it getting stuck . a brand new machine should not have these issues .

__label__negative the phones only worked for about a month and then would not communicate with my cell phone . i do credit the supplier they did give me a refund .

__label__negative worked days and blew out

__label__negative it is sturdy but it is not gray it is filing cabinet beige colored

__label__negative with new black cartridge it says black ink low and cannot print black docs ? less than a year old

__label__negative these would not stick on plastic in high humidity summer outdoors  .

__label__negative it probably is a nice game but my kids did not like it too much . ages  . they like playing with the stick figures though .

__label__negative it stopped working in three months

__label__negative they are batteries and they worked .

__label__negative these were already expired when i received them . not too happy about that but so far they seem to work just fine .

__label__negative like looking in a funhouse mirror . reflection is very distorted .

__label__negative just what i needed .

__label__negative clamps seem to strip out when tightening even medium size sets of plans . works great for lighter sets .

__label__negative not what i was wanting

__label__negative more for home use

__label__negative color cartridge did not work in my printer

__label__negative poor product quatlity ! printer failed to recognize that the shipping lock had been removed .

__label__negative low price . works for what we need .

__label__negative not what i expected  . bigger than the picture and does not work well .

__label__negative black ink is good . i am having trouble with the printer reading the colored cartridge so i can not use it .

__label__negative looks so cheap .

__label__negative did not charge my razr v when connected to any usb charger . did charge the phone only when connected to a pc . why motorola why ?

__label__negative too bubbly .

__label__negative stars are only for arrival time . product in its self was basic and was intentionally ordered for that purpose .

__label__negative read the fine print . assorted does not mean that you can the same number of every color .

__label__negative i am happy with the print quality wireless setup and everyday use . the rating lost stars because you cannot print anything if a color is out of ink .

__label__negative i cannot get these to work without crinkling . was much happier with the scotch brand thermal laminating pouches and will order those again instead .

__label__negative not apple compatible .

__label__negative home use only really does not hold up well to above average use . really needs used with premium staples .

__label__negative too small

__label__negative the cartridge fit into my printer but it would not let me print at all kept saying low ink replace cartridge .

__label__negative finally arrived the pkg was torn and pencils were sticking out .

__label__negative is not always reliable to print wirelessly

__label__negative my tween girls each used one of these to start the school year . both girl s pouches lasted less than a week . the zippers broke on both used .

__label__negative my five year old can write a more exciting novel .

__label__negative great paper quality but my optical mouse does not respond well on it . looks like this will be just a note pad for me

__label__negative they did not because only one of them work and the other one did not work ......

__label__negative all cartridges needed to be returned . poor performance

__label__negative did not work at all send it back

__label__negative the description says and it is  . it does not fit in the spot i had intended to hang it

__label__negative unfortunately this was not desired size but we kept items to prevent trouble of returning . we were looking for normal size x  . thank you .

__label__negative necessary evil .

__label__negative not the greatest . seems to be made . but i guess you get what you pay for . it does work

__label__negative ink was not as dark as i would like but they did write smoothly .

__label__negative not good at all so hard to puch front wheel does not work  .iam returning this product  .i was disappointed  .i do not recommend this product

__label__negative not as we thought . not really pro . just ok and we returned for different mead style .

__label__negative very cheap quality arrived with sticky stuff on cover . had to return

__label__negative met my expectations . thanks !

__label__negative my son loves the dimondbacks . got for back to school . great product but the wholes do not line up with a ring binder .

__label__negative the case is great . unfortunately the tripod was not so good . i used it twice and it broke .

__label__negative they write slightly nicer than the bic multipens but leak like fiends . i just opened this pen this morning . so glad i did not toss it in my handbag !

__label__negative sleek design but not efficiency

__label__negative my printer brother mfc j dw does not detect these ink cartridges . very unhappy .

__label__negative this product does not work and also has a no return policy on it ...do not buy this  !!!

__label__negative the worst ever cartridges that i have seen . spoiled my printer leaked as soon as they are installed . do not buy them .

__label__negative the bulb has to be modified to fit though it lists as a replacement for the projector .

__label__negative i bought this item and it did not work i tried to ask for a replacement one and this company did not offer one to me ! not happy about that

__label__negative works well

__label__negative does not work for our business . amazon support was wonderful better than the manufacturer .

__label__negative one out of the four did not work ..other than that they get the job done .

__label__negative the stickiness of the magnets barely holds anything . it would even hold a single piece of laminated paper to a whiteboard . magnet strength is poor as well .

__label__negative works pretty good for about half a cartridge then starts to lose color

__label__negative the black seems to work ok but the color ones either run out too quickly or my printer is having trouble figuring out they are there .

__label__negative pens are cheaply made but ok for the price

__label__negative the ink cartridges did not work for my printer . i returned them . quiet an incnvience .

__label__negative be careful . this product is not quality standard gaffer tape . it left residue all over our stage .

__label__negative it was a gift .

__label__negative one of the legs plastic got all soft and it would not grip on anymore .

__label__negative leak and smear

__label__negative would not work .

__label__negative some of the cartridges did not work

__label__negative these cartridges do not work . the mess with the settings on your printer as well . so upset i wasted my money  !!

__label__negative the paper does its job but i only got one of the three packs promised which was disappointing .

__label__negative while convenient to choose which tab will stand up the others have to be tucked and i am not all that dexterous or patient . colors are bright and the folders feel solid .

__label__negative low quality stuff . you get what you pay for

__label__negative spews out too much ink .

__label__negative worked fine for months then suddenly stopped working . not recommended .

__label__negative well it prints ... but my printer still says its empty . i guess this toner and the printer do not play nice . but it does print .

__label__negative good product good price .

__label__negative these suck ! spend the money for the actual brand name ones

__label__negative too small to be useful for me

__label__negative hugely overrated broke jammed within the first weeks of use . horrible junk .

__label__negative the stapler occasionally jams a bit disappointing that way .

__label__negative ink was all dried up and did not work .

__label__negative my first impression with this product it is overpriced and cheaply made . i have not taken a lot of time with it todate and i am hoping it will accomplish what i need .

__label__negative really need to update picture . this is not the item you will receive if you order it . was very up set .

__label__negative ver disappointed were all dried up before i could use them all .

__label__negative holds lots of cards ....wish it had the security cover that we are forced to use so information is not stolen .

__label__negative the cartridges do not work with my hp printer . the printer just does not accept these cartridges .

__label__negative works ok still is messy to use it leaks price is cheap for its troubles .

__label__negative product was defective . the tape and the transfer layer were spun wrong .

__label__negative surprisingly cheap quality esp given price we returned headed over to staples in town instead .

__label__negative phone would not port up

__label__negative so messy and did not work for me the printer kept saying need name brand refills

__label__negative do not buy you get what pay for i guess these ran out of ink immediately so obviously they were only partially filled . what a waste

__label__negative product works but not getting performance of original cartridges .

__label__negative no staples to start out !!

__label__negative quality is poor

__label__negative its very light ..simple ....but worthy for price
