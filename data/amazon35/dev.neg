it is not the same as my stock cartrage did not work
 of the was broken but the other are as described
i need a manual for this stapler . it taples everyth with staples . is this a defect or is there a way to use singe staples ?
the one black ink cartridge was messed up and did not work
it is a ok item .
poorly constructed .
i thought the bottles were bigger but other than that i am satisfied . just a suggest though maybe you could put how many ounces the bottles are .
it is not fine point and takes long time to link coming out .
the sheets come apart too easily
its okay . my first professional ink
weakest boxes i have ever seen . there is not even an industry rating on the bottom flap . i would never purchase these again .
this ink cartridge is region locked . this means that if your printer is not from the united states i am european it will not work on your printer .
my mistake i assumed it would copy as well . nor did the consumer report indicate this
i cannot use it . imposible to calibrate .
these are just regular pens . i was looking for something with a little glide but these will do . the grip is also nice .
a piece was broken off a corner exposing sharp metal and the broken piece was taped inside the lid !
one does not work
of the three cartridges one black had leaked inside the box . have not tried them yet . ok price if at least two work properl  .
some pages were smudged makeing them unusable .
jammed during first use . returned to amzn .
had to return this because not all sims cards fit ! i tried verizon !
static when you pick up the receiver about half the time so basically unusable .
we could not get the plastic off the main set . it was a mess so i returned it !
 cartridge did not fit .
the first unit was damaged by fedex and never worked the replacement worked ok then it took over one hour to scan an image and then it would not work at all . returned
could not use product as instructed ...returned .
flimsy product not as good as the original . very dirty with yellow rust stains when delivered . had to scrub it clean .
we tried to get this working for weeks and finally gave up . pages with ink splotches are not usable . this was a waste of money .
did not hole up well .
the pen that is pictured in the advertisement is not what i received . the one that was sent to me is a cheap knock off .
cannot see the buttons really well at night .
you have to be tech savvy here ...i am not so found this a waste of money will be giving to my daughter to figure it out then she will show me .
its too small and it does not work properly
not at all as shown in picture . stuck with item because return shipping would cost more than the actual item .
i have used it very lightly for a week or so and it has stopped working  . i have called a help telephone number and have been unable to connect with that number .
the cartridges was very easy to install and the price is good . just as the seller pictured is just what i received . they arrived as stated and will purchase this again .
bought it for quick reference pages . which are great . overall quality seems cheap for the price . size is ok .
ok but flimsy !
pretty useless and flimsy could not get to work under my desk . returned it .
when i buy a product i really am not looking to have to buy all the cords separate . a printer should come with everything it needs to work . very displeased over all .
too expensive .
cute while it lasted . we did get a year out of it . lights stopped working .
not good .
there are four cartridges in this package . two of them magenta and black are defective .
sadly the generics for this printer do not work well . the brother ones do but are pricey .
stands crooked not sturdy expensive for what i received . 
short life span of these cartriages
my children wanted to sharpen their pencils before their first day of school and they were on their th pencil when the sharpeners broke . do not buy these . too cheap .
inferior to strathmore s lb bristol artist s tiles .
sent me the wrong size .
not good for calligraphy but nice pen .
heavy enough but not clear i expected to be clear . product is opaque more than clear . okay i guess but not what i expected or wanted .
the position of the handle makes it difficult to operate .
the cartridge did not work right out of the box
i have only used this once so i am not prepared to give it a full review .
does not work for a filofax domino ! i am so disappointed ! now i have to start over .
think this may be old stock as it refused to wind out of the labeler . seems stuck . good price but did not work . will return for replacement .
this is just a bad product . the file folders inside have no way to stay put . they fall out continually . maybe staples or glue to hold them in .
i used all of the cleaner still does not work ... please refund ...
very poor no ink in any of them is there an expiration date on them ? please advise
it is chalk
i have had many canon printers and this is the very worse . put in a new cartridge and you can go have dinner waiting for the printer to get started again .
i do not know if i receive the free six month so no !!!
these were the worst quality expo markers . my students had them for less than a week and i had to replace half my class !
did not like the way they packaged this .. they rolled it up and when i got it i cannot get it to stay flat on my computer table
it is ink . it is on prime . it works . no matter where i bought it i would think it was too expensive but it is competitively priced .
it failed on install
these are half sheet lifters not full page . for my binders these were rendered nearly useless .
small for a pencil pouch and not high quality but okay for small child .
much more complicated than what i needed . returned it
mic is very weak so you have to talk very loud to be heard .
did not work with my car stereo .
awful piece of junk . do not even get cans shown . most are asian writing and pictures . were broken when they arrived .
slightly smaller than the time cards we got from lathem
light went out after hrs of use . sent it back
is not worth the money you might save since the quality of the print is barely visible and the colors do not print out at all . stick to the brand names .
it worked for two weeks
using these toner cartridges void the warranty on my samsung printer . buyers should be aware of this .
broken when it arrived .
did not think about labels on each file . they prevent lid from closing fully .
received the envelopes however they were neon pink not truly a hot pink as described in the listing or shown in the picture and they clashed with our invitations  .
cheap little box . we returned it when we found a better one at a local comic book store for the price and better quality .
not as sticky as expected
does not stick to the wall . used a variety of adhesives . thin tears disappointed .
so darn narrow . bought grippers and hopefully that will help . using that tight a pinch grip is not very relaxing .
cannot rate a product that does not work .
the color one worked fine but the black ink continuously gave me issues . wound up having to buy another one .
very clunky interface ! the build is not good either .
these are flimsy and i was very disappointed in the sizing . i am hoping that i will be able to return them .
material is thinn and leaves black steaks from rollers would not buy this again .
to much 
as expected .
as expected .

beautiful colours but a bit hard to write on .
low cost ink jet printers are a total ripp off as soon as you need to start buying replacement cartridges .
was to big and when i call for see if can i change do not let me send back
over priced ! way over priced !
very cheap literally just used these on a key ring and they break . do not buy .
kind of hard to set up after i read directions x it was ok
i personally hated everything about it but then again if you are making crappy workplace ids then this is your go to shipping was fairly decent . everything was incuded . overall fair price
refilled ink cartridges cannot work like a genuine but its ok if print quality is not important . the seller has good customer help support which i really appreciate .
paid waaay to much for this ..after a month and hardly used it the binding is worn
did not work still for drum error .
no answering machine capability on the phone .
love the brand but these set of pens came with ink that ran out after a few uses . i believe there were air bubbles .
too small . i expected it to be bigger . the material was okay but i would not want to buy it again
this worked great for a couple of days . then it began getting constant paper jams .
fun to experiment with fountain pens and my g .f . likes the color selection . now i am addicted . thanks obama !
started to use and big stringy pieces came out . the more liquid material works okay .
i only sharpened one pencil then it suddenly broke for no reason
okay device not very bright though
these were permanent . not non permanent . seriously ? do not buy from bestsource officesupplies  .
cannot use it with this machine . waste of my  .
eats ink like crazy . there are no other brand ink for it .
it works but these generic drums do not last long .
it is a very good item for the right price i have an issue when printing graphics it makes a light grey over the whole page .
one broke the first day ...
one plastic part came broken . it was not an essential part but still .. also not moving smoothly on carpet
ok binder .
the black ink cartridge works fine but the color one had leaked all over inside the package . only the pink part of the of the ink cartridge actually prints .
the left arms screws are not firm so the left monitor kept on drooping unless you were very careful about moving it around . i eventually stopped using it .
the actual color was not as bright as the picture .
lots of problems getting the printing to match up all across and down the page . i gave up rather than keep on with the struggle .
be careful when opening box . cut my finger super bad !!! ok . still jams like the other tape guns .
too small
i expected it to be sturdier but it served it is purpose after a few staples . not very big but fit most of the goodies i put in there ..
installed once received one week later stopped working . figured if i bought the more expensive one it would last me more than a week . 
fell apart after one use . tried to pin it back still did not work .
holds a lot of information but the information is too small for old eyes to read
speaker does not work . redial does not work . hold does not work . can only dial out and answer phone
the color cassettes worked great . the xxl black cassette was defective and would not work . will purchase locally so i can return for exchange .
it is ok .
works just like any other roll of this kind of tape .
broke the st week
 out of pouches did not fit in a binder . all of the holes are off by aboit inch .
fuzzy printing .....i would have returned it but i was out of the country for a week then in the hospital for two weeks ...so now i am two days past returnability
as advertised
it feels good on wrist but smells really bad .
nice sturdy pencil how ever the mechanics suck leads very difficult to change twisting and twisting but the leads do not retract like suppose to .
very little tape on the roll .
very flimsy . pegs do not work to hold the tablet against surface .
unfortunately of the folders had broken zipper mechanisms .
it was maths graph paper i wanted lined paper
would not have bought this if i had seen it in person . if you just want a card with a moose it is fine but as a high end d card it disappointed .
still got drum error . no help from company . piece of junk .
does not last long .
hanset died in less than one year .
it does not work . disappointed .
the pin is too long for my cork board ..sigh . love the look . perhaps i can shorten them but will i lose the pinning ability ? still yet to try .
it is okay
most of the sticks are cracked
i have had nothing but problems with this printer from connectivity issues to printer failure . i advise potential buyers to look elsewhere .
this product sucks ! all three of the chargers were defective . none of them work do not buy
the quality is nice but the picture is inaccurate . there is not a black or navy border . it is just gray with a border indentation .
this was the second lamp that i had purchased for the television and the least expensive by far  . i am happy with both the product and the seller
you are only getting one . better prices on other sites .
did not work waste of money . i have another ir extender which works great . this one never ever worked and i tried a dozen times .
i ended up returning it . the quality of the phone was really bad it felt like a toy phone . plus i hated the ring tones .
it is a dark blue and it is a lot bigger than i thought it would be
calculator stopped working after less than days of use .
installed in my pixma mx and now it broke my printer
my printer informed me that the toner cartridges were not genuine after double checking sure enough they are knock offs .
too small to hold hardback book . rolled off of my father in law s rather belly .
find a different brand . this selection of rings extremely hard to open leaving my fingers sore in the process . i was completely unable to open of the  .
rarely need a rubber band of these sizes but handy when i do .
the paper clip holder did not have a magnetic strip !!! i want my money back or be sent a new one !
just what i needed no longer need to write it every time . tine saver !
i needed the pack i .e . paper and ink but this only had paper
i do not know
very nice pen writes fine .
for what it is it is a good deal compared to the over priced stuff in the stores .... but still over priced .
very weak
these are advertised as and measure no more than  . also the velcro design barely holds . do not buy .
this is a worthless piece of junk . it often grinds down half of a pencil before producing a useable tip . do not buy .
did not come with header cards as shown in photo . quality was ok . it looks like a folded up cardboard box with white ink on the outside .
smaller than expected but does the job .
did not stick to surface ! roll went to goodwill !
i was so excited to buy these but when i got them i was not as impressed as everyone else with the quality . i do not think they are worth the price .
what can you say it came on time and was the same as i have used befor
overpriced for a piece of leather tied around a notebook . it is definitely a trend but not a necessity .
serves its purpose but is very light weight . i expected the paper to be a better quality ...
so far the toner streaks on the page ...in to inch streaks ...i am still trying to see if they will work
smaller than i thought they will be but they stick to all the school supplies without a problem .
not worth to pay this much
this toner is not as a good as i thought to be ?
not very strong scissors .
they do work well however i have gotten a new phone since i purchased these batteries and they do not fit my new phone .
product is good . a little miss leading when they show three but it is not a package deal its just one individual letter opener that you are buying .
difficult to install as wireless not possible without cable . paper tray for output not long enough to catch printouts .
had to return . was not at all what i expected . disappointing .
i started filling this out and found it had march pages and no april page . not worth sending it bck . quality control needs to rev up . otherwise its perfect
was not what i wanted not for use on dry erase boards
printer shows inkjet is empty and sometimes causes communication error with printer and computer
please maje a combo pack with all the colors including grey !
ok but a little flimsy .
definitely not heavy duty instead being light plastic . they are work but they are not the quality that i was looking for
these cartridges did not work in my printer . the printer was unable to detect that they were even in place .
smaller than expected . the picture is misleading .
got the wrong item pictured twice .
very disapointed with the product  .out of one only worked ..not worth the money paid for it ..
the top clip came off already and had to be fixed . not a very quality product
could not figure how to make them work .
i hated these pens . they look streaky no matter how many times you color over the same spot . even crayolas are better than these .
not what expected . did not work right and had the warranty label broken through already . do not buy from this bogus company !
ink faded quickly .
these are cute but some of them were broke when i received them . not the best quality .
these did not work for the application i intended to use them for but they are of ok quality just a tad flimsy .
it does not fit in the plotter .
it is good for a very basic printer . print quality ok ink usage ok .
works okay but the chair is very small and too close to the ground for me to feel comfortable using the chair .
ok . cyan toner ran out after days .
it is not working . they sent me a damaged product ....
as expected .
does not last nearly as long as other brands of ink i have purchased .
the bag is well made and looks professional . my nec projector however is a very tight fit . make sure the actual size of your projector fits comfortably in the interior space
this is constantly getting tipped over
they leak . not sure why .
usually w this printer it comes a black and colored  . my printer will not print w this ink in it ! i would like to return it or exchange it .
flimsier than expected but probably quality meets the price
it breaks too quick . it is not recommend for restaurant .
item was unnecessary as the portable tv i purchased it to hold a had a built in stand and b did not work anyway and i had to return both items .
although this is supposed to last a lot longer than other toner cartridges it seems to run out pretty quickly . okay for some projects but i would not recommend it for everything .
this thing is pretty small and i have to put my eye right on top of it to see anything . otherwise it works pretty good and the illumination is a nice feature .
i have had this for one semester in nursing school and the paint around the edging has chipped and worn to reveal a purple undercoat that looks tacky .
great product hard to find was happy to get it
delivered on time . we all need ink for our printers . wish epson would gouge us so much with pricing ?? to offset the cost i always get the high capacity cartridges .
high resistance wiring made in china  . does not work with valentineone products .
had to glue the clip together it was coming apart
cute but stones fall off by neck
did not work
unhappy . not cut to correct size and not user friendly to install . do not waste your time .
i put seven cards and it broke .
airprint but not wireless . really ?!?
ok but not stellar .
they are ok . next time i will get the large volume cartages that brother suggest i use .
its old product . only month for expiry
very difficult to fill the cartridge nothing like the instructions say in terms of how difficult it is .
fell apart on first use . unable to repair
supplier was perfect . price for these inks are crazy . glad its not my unit ! 
the black ink cartridges do not print out but it would say that it is full .
really helps the pressure on the back . needs to be a little wider
thicker but not at all soft
the item did not worked ..
they state it is small but honestly did not think i could even write in it more like mini
simple cheap great while it works . however ... one day it just stopped working . so ... not super impressed . less than year of regular use .
the black ink did not work at all in the printer .
the xl cartridge runs our of ink just as fast as the smaller cartridge
stopped working months later . hour hand lost its tension . tried to fix to no avail .
ok for the price . but i expected larger letters .
had to work on it to fit my needs
these are not as advertised . they are barely mm in diameter and barely mm in height .
ink is incredibly expensive . printer only prints one sided . cannot make multiple scans in a row without having to reopen the whole process each time . other than that good printer .
this tape is terrible . it does not stick . rips easily . very poor quality . do not buy it !
the owner s manual is terrible . nothing about the system calls for anything other than stars .
attempted to use this on bikes for burning man ...did not do anything .
i ordered these by mistake . i wanted the assorted colored rubber bands . sorry !
orange cartridge was assessed by my printer as not full deficient .
it works if you do not mind a black steel cabinet in your home it is just fine . i would think it is a little flimsy for office work .
the first sets of these were great . the quality went consistently downhill and i was changing cartridges after printing only a few pages .
good for webcasts and like . but for meetings the other person would not hear my voice clearly with this .
as expected .
disappointed at the product . it does not cut a straight line . see the photo .
product arrived slightly bent but i had planed to remove it from it is original frame cork is a little thin but suitable
returned never worked
total waste of money . this piece of junk never worked right . i regret not retuning it immediately .
half of them do not work
it was not the battery the head phones did not work any more .
they do not work had to take circuit boards off old brother cartridges to get them to work . printer would not recognize these will not buy again .
for small jobs
the image on the mousepad is stretched to fit and poor quality . utter crap .
not the same size they feet but to tide
the ruber band came off and the plastic holders are seperating
lasted months then burnt out . i wonder if it was used .
this product did not stick at all . put in on and it fell off within hours . boy does that hurt with it comes off with the catheter attached !!!!
they do not seem to clean as advertised .
great exercises .
not very dark like my others were
this says that it the nd edition but i received the th edition .
what can you say it came and it worked as always
poor packaging . several sheets had ragged edges .
adequate service with lackluster instructions . at times calls are disrupted probably when service is busy . good value for a service not as polished as major carriers .
we ordered this one because of the purple color and it arrived in a blue color !
it is a good panner but not worth this price
too small
it is nice and the paper is good quality but it is only four subjects sections of notebook paper . screwed me because i am takin five courses . ugh 
the poster was completely wrinkled in numerous places . i will not be using this
a good product but overpriced printer toner is a scam in general i think .
cheaply made ! arrived damaged !
i bought this because i needed these specific colors . they substituted the red with orange . also the brands were mixed . way overpriced .
not strong colors
the only heavy duty part of this binder is the rings . the plastic hinge was not strong enough to support the covers . i sent this back immediately .
i bought this as a gift for my friend he absolutly loved it but i defiantly did not get my moneys worth .
paint makes it look a little plastic .
these are too darn narrow . i need a death grip to hang on . hoping some grippers will help me .
nice book but very small . maybe pages ? wish it had more pages . i might use it for a trip but not a comprehensive birding journal
lovely but expensive
cheap quality
very noisy when it is warming up and when you are laminating .
when i bought this printer i was desperate ... i never dreamed that when i got it i would have to order the cords to it separate . very displeased .
it seemed to work good and then after using two weeks the ink dried up in two of my pens
i ordered the calendar received which i already had not worth ordering again disappointed
good pens it writes very well
adhesive was cheap and did not any on screen
this phone is alright . it takes long to dial a number but that is my only complaint
a little flimsy .
does not work the way it is supposed to very difficult to change leads especially if you have clumsy fingers like mine .
low quality
ok for the price
unfortunately the paper arrived crumpled and i had to use it anyway . more concern should be devoted to packaging to prevent this mishap .
does not work on my new phones . worked fine on my panosonic phones but not with my new at t system so be careful .
not quite big enough for my large print bible
stuck to the plastic
do not deserve one star also . when i put this ink in my printer it shows less than of ink
unfortunately two little pieces have already broken off .
this turned out to be so small !
re asin b xlpeuru x lettersize freehand designer sheets . draw perfect straight lines templates . x grid sheet for scale drawings x protractor sheet for angles . received only sheet .
never got all the parts . might be a good machine .
be aware that this is a very small book . check the measurements
they are okay but kind of flimsy bend too easily . if the wire was stronger did not bend they would be great .
not that great . it is a messy product .
good price .
not good . not working at all . bad buy
just like any other paper .
quick delivery . loved the look of them but dropped one and it broke in half . was not expecting that
does not work
does not come with carbon slips as stated in the description . if you order this be sure to order some slips too .
a little too small velcro straps do not fit correctly
f you ink companies for charging so much for ink .
very limited to what you can do . it will print two lines if you make the font smaller if you need that . easy to use .
the pen was nice to look at but no matter what i did it would not work .
my oki would not recognize there is units . do not buy these
awful . my printer prints blue and yellow now . this was a rip off .
difficult to punch out the slot where the clip band goes through the card holder .
not bad at all for the price now all of us in the office look like astronauts . 
it needs a  . male plug i do not like that volume control mute button . i bough one before and it was simple . head set
they are really not that funny . i think out of the bunch there are that are moderately humerous .
it did not fit the model of phone .
i will not purchase again . our plotter does not recognize the cartridge . cannot use this product in the future .
black ink head broke within the year .
thanks
they are already spotted and tarnished !! poor product .
lousy product . horrible sound quality .
thank you
the pen is self would not stay inside the container of the keychain
i like it but its much too expensive for what it is . it took a long time to get her because it was shipped directly from the orient .
fits label maker perfectly and good printing .  ..but the back of the tape is extremely difficult to remove . i will not reorder this item .
the ink runs out faster than you can order it .
garbage not as advertised different brand under weight do not buy this
so far it apears to be working fine i love its simplicity . i feel i can hang anything on it .....lots of room .
they are cheap . some handles came broken off already . since the only use i have is for lightweight paper goods it is not that much of a problem .
what i received was over a week late and included two magnets . not as advertised . i am disappointed .
it was toooo tiny . i was about to throw it away with the packaging which had other things ! not a good decision on my part 
some cartridges were empty and soilled a lot of ink .
beautiful and sounds great . mine came with a few scratches unfortunately but still nice
was bought for my son
did not have much need for this .
it reset my chips alright right to the point where the printer will not recognize the cartridges any longer . waste of money .
not what i was expected . i thought it would be made of a thick medal but it was flimsy like heavy duty aluminum foil . the way it was packaged it was bent .
came without the part that holds the lead for the pencil . took forever to get and they forgot a simple quality check . what a waste of time .
could not program
did not print as many pages as it says ...blew through it in a couple of weeks and only printed approx pages . i even changes printer setting for econ printing before installing the toner
as expected .
the glare on the navi screen got worse with this worthless piece of plastic . so we removed it !
its broken now .
i guess it works .
barely prints . canon should stick to camers !
nice and durable .
the hook did not really fit my door due to the lack of the gap space . shall it fit it would have been a great product .
it is cute and everything but i am not sure if it is worth  . staples are also mini so good luck finding the refills .
this ink is great for the first few print but the print quality degrades very quickly . i am also skeptical about the print volume as it runs out fairly quickly . very disappointed .
we loved the product but it arrived bent from shipping and we were unable to hang it on the wall in my daughter s dorm room .
looks great and nice construction but i cannot get it to work with my optical mouse . so useless as a result .
very poor quality . tips pull back in so the only way to use it is to hold the button with your hand while using it . very inconvenient .
arrived damaged . returned it and bought a different scale elsewhere .
it does not stick this tape is a waste and tried to contact seller no response
did not work very well  ..there were parts and no directions as to it should b e loaded .
my hp printer would not accept this cartridge even after following sellers instructions . sent back for refund without a problem .
the pens dry up with min use .
the hp black cartridge ran out after approximately pages ! i have been buying hp ink for many years and i have never had a cartridge run out this fast .
if you are lucky you will get a cartridge that works .
modest product at a modest price ... lots of minor imperfections ... smells of chemicals
set up was real easy everything works okay but if you are going to sell a white printer then display a white printer .
reception very poor when you walk about or more feet away from the base .
to small . it fits the planner i got just fine but i cannot put regular sized paper in it . very cute though .
within days of use the handle started ripping away from the top of the binder and the shoulder strap broke .
the clear film had smear like mark on it and i could not remove it .
it came out ok but started to come off after the first wash . do not buy !
this was a good buy except the yellow toner did not fit or work for the hp 
it projects well but the sound is so quiet it is useless for showing movies or videos
broke dys after i got itb
now i am using the little hand held sharpeners and getting much better results .
they are really good sharpeners . but the only problem is that they are not durable . they will not last very long and break .
average
epson used to provide good efficient inexpensive home printers . this is not one . it is user unfriendly and eats ink faster than any printer i have owned .
it did not work . it was just a generic remote replacement . no manual no website no batteries no nothing except a long wait .
would not work at all in my system . keeps saying it is not genuine .
received a defective product then had to pay to have it shipped back to finland ! not ok !
both of the bronze markers were completely dry right out of the packaging .
do not buy !!! it arrived empty !!!
could be softer
i did not get in the container . plus it did not come in the container that is shown on here . this was a waste of many .
broke to easy
i should have paid more and gotten a better one
very flimsy
this is a one way book on good for one follow through
it makes a very loud noise when the paper is been shredded .
toner produces a medium grey print . one of the cartridges was broken . the get what you pay for .
not m brand but seem ok .
okay .
product is fine but the shipping process was terrible .
good but freezes up and clogs
they were ok but i expected better . next time i will go to local office supply store re
unsat ! the fan was received in unsatisfactory condition . when turned on the bearings rattled loudly .
the liquid in the spray bottle was spill out all over other markers and other package . the entire package complete soaking wet .
my own fault for buying something so cheap
stiil too expensive
the bottom tray was broke off when it arrived
i printed on these using a laser printer ant it runs ! wipes off ! does not work !
i am disappointed with the display . it is very hard to see .
be careful . back that attaches to cabinet has a gap the loose papers can slip down through .
i have not tried the black yet but the color cartridge only held yellow ink .
lacks the fifth cartridge needed pgpk so you have to buy it separately .
received mine with a hole in the backing
worked as it was supposed to did a good holster for gun
these are darling however they do not fit a pencil !! these are not pencil cases ! they are not long enough to fit a pencil !
when i received it it was a little stained
it was not what i wanted and i sent it back .
one cord came broken and the other lasted about a week before the port broke off . never again
do not buy
only lasts about month with an average amount of use in a medical office but considering its price it seems to be a fair to good value .
all the stones fell of within a week
missing batteries
the band broke pin lost on the first day i wore it to work .
trying to figure out if this is still working for skype or not .
worked fine for a short while then broke .
they are amazingly cheap . but they are cheap . i bought these months ago and used them for photo printing . after a few months i notice my photos are fading .
horrible defective hopefully the defect will show up in the photo seriously can not believe that this company shipped this to me ...
sucks can only weigh heavy jewelry
the ink is okay but there is not very much ink in the cartridge for the amount of money i paid for it .
seems a bit flimsy .
the quality of the paper is not well . adhesive is not good either
got it for my grandchildren and they seem to make use of it . it erases pretty good .
do not waste your money none of this cartridges work after try cartridges on separate orders . hp cartridges work fine .
yellow and magenta colors did not work . i am hoping they did not permanently damage my new printer .
ticonderoga pencils are the best but these write nothing like them . these also do not erase very well even with an otherwise fantastic eraser . sorely disappointed .
this is the second one i have purchased . both times they blew out after weeks . guess i know why they were cheap . do not bother .
did not last long at all and had trouble with my lexmark printer accepting it !
one of the storage lids was cracked
the inks were not epson and would not work properly .
need to pull it to the left . otherwise will not cut .
everything crumble
would not fit in the drawer that i had in mind . so i used it differently . it was longer then the measurements i needed . other then that it serves my purposes .
thought it would be metal but turns out to be plastic . not very sturdy .
only one folder came when it is listed as folders .
nice but the pictures on the card do not cue to what the word is .
if it was possible to leave no stars i would . pencils that you cannot sharpen are worthless . these are worthless .
the black ink is not working 
this desk is only worth about bucks do not buy
the clip is very loose . it falls off much of the time .
my daughter ordered this for her pens and pencils most of them broke or split open within a week or two . japanese product made in china .
absolute garbage . with light pressure you cannot scratch off the foil . with slightly more pressure the printed layer came off with it . this lasted about seconds out of the tube .
bulb did not work
it worked for a few pages and then it started getting streaky and blurry and just terrible . and i am outside the refund period . awful .
cheap quality . got to use a few of the items . the rest were useless .
ordered light purple received dark blue . exchanged received light purple but package missing keyboard protector . extremely dissatisfied
distance from the unit seems to be the problem . when to far or on another level in the house reception is not great . lots of static at times .
thought they would be a very fine point they are more like medium . if you want medium then they are a star
cheap and poorly made . it is a three pack for a reason .
cute post it is but the adhesive is very weak . i have to tape the sticky note to my planner to make it stay .
not bad if your looking for a cheap basic box . cannot beat the price ! good for school supplies if your not overly concerned about quality .
credit card does not fit . came all folded over and crushed
always jammed and returned for refund ... still waiting ..
so sad to say but i am not able to get the printer to recognize this cartridge as full . it worked for a day but now its no longer .
exactly as advertised . no problems .
they tend to dry out quickly which is probably why our printer and these tanks are discontinued in stores .
it appeared in the pic that it was white not clear . i have no use for it and wasted my money
it did not have one of the functions i needed
it sucks do not get it
my lefty son did not like the soft flex handles .
the quality was there however it took a long time to receive them .
i already returned it with printer together .
it is all right i which it was on both sides
very nice classy look
it is a good scissors . i personally like one that is sharper for my use this would be good for children .
it is huge
works ok but letters on the on and off buttons have worn off after only a few to several months with average use . audio needs to be moderately better .
i thought it was more thicker . than it really is ! i feel it could snap anytime in the near future !
it was fine though not as strong it as flexible as i would hoped .
having trouble with cartridges printing . they do not last very long .
much smaller than i thought they would be .
do not like the way the ink dries up so does not flow from previous use . ink cartridges do not stay in place so get messy when you open that area .
the grade book is fine . the shipping method of a flexible paper object in a plastic envelope is ridiculous . the book was received with deep creases in it .
not compatible with fast charging for my note 
might work alright for a telephone but i used this for my modem and my dsl speed dropped by about  . probably a low quality cable .
you get what you pay for . i just wanted a voice recorder . i did not need a recorder with all the modes this recorder has !!
only one of the cartridges works . but the one that works seems to be good .
will not fit in mine or my husband s wallet and i bought sets .
do not buy this product . the print quality is awful . it smears and missed lines when it prints .
should have markings for the amount of coins when they do not fill the tube . a older version made by another manufacturer did and my cashiers loved the time saving counting their drawers .
they dry out
does not work if keypad is on the receiver . this was not mentioned in the ad . did not realize until i had opened the package . money wasted .
glue did not stick . had to return them
i hate hate hate this printer ! you will regret buying this thing ! i just wanted a simple printer and it is anything but !
hard to get the ink flowing . but it does what it says . the cap broke on mine and the ink was all gone within days after that .
does not have enough tension or recoil but other than that works well for clipping badges onto pants belt loops .
dided fixed
it is okay packing tape . it holds well and worked for what i needed it for .
i feel crazy because i do not really understand the hype about these pens . they write fine they erase well but they are just okay .
did not work with my epson x  . i tried cleaning the nozzles several times and no luck .
good length and strong hardware . fair price .
does not work with my canon series ...are not recognised . thereafter i was forced to clean the printer because the ink tank are not well sealed .
quality is average but in line with the price .
waste money ! bad quarlity !
cannon printer would not accept this product although my model was listed on the package side .. waste of money . opened and not returnable ..
these are not wilson jones binders . they are a random generic brand . very unhappy with the misleading branding !
not really happy about this you would have to buy additional equipment about  . for it to work as it should .
they do not work . very weak magnets . waste of money takes to hold a piece of paper up
i thought it was very flimsy and the pink plastic was very bubbly all over thought it was way overpriced .
good quality made in the usa but they are so thick some keys do not fit .
ink did not work in my printer even though it said it was compatible . waste of money and no way to contact seller .....
the cushion is too hard and you wrist hurts after using the pad for a while
the photo shows tablets but i only received one box of tablets . misadvertised . buy somewhere else .
no good
always leaves side of staple in paper have tried different ways of pulling out staples nothing works . are very sturdy and well built .
not so good
there is not much there .
sucked
it did fool my son who used it for his hair but the brush is super light and the two pieces separate to easy .
was what i expected
the product came apart the first day . very poor quality . but i guess you get what you pay for . please do not buy .
it broke where you hook your keys on after like weeks of using it 
i ordered boxes and none of the ink cartridges worked which is crazy because i have been ordering my ink from amazon for several years now .
the pouches should have come with the cardboard carrier but otherwise good .
the snap does not stay snapped and the reel gets stuck often . it is just a matter of time before breaks like the rest .
worked nothing special and batteries did not last as long as they should have .
was not compatible with my mac computer and had to return it . it would have been nice if that issue were noted in the write up on amazon .
oooooohhhhhhweeee
garbage cheaply made no real protection from other than dust as far as i can see .......
dried up before i got to use it up .
the item helps greatly in reading the text key names but has to be removed to put the calculator back in its she will .
it has a tendancy to slide around a lot and is already beginning to show some signs of wear after only a few weeks
i expected the image to be small and i expected it to be not high quality however it was really difficult to see unless it was pitch dark in the room .
the liquid in the spray bottle was spill out all over other markers and other package . the entire package complete soaking wet .
i loved this folder ... until the lock the reason i purchased it broke weeks after purchase .
does not work do not waste your money .
 of paperweights i received from fringe studio were defective to varying degrees cracked bottoms defects within the paperweight i am astounded that they send these out and charge total rip off
ordered this and then realized it was for last year .
the phones are okay ! if you have a granddaughter that calls you and talks for hours though the battery goes dead too quickly !
cannot see movies with a phone memory
soft leather
defective disappointing really awful that this company sends these out ...
poorly made and a knob was missing .
sleeves are too large for standard plastic window holder for wallet . i had to trim down to size to make work .
although they preformed as expected the seem to cut into the paper . as if the ball is locking up .
does not fit my cross mechanical pencils . this is what happens when american companies sell out to china for 
they work but be careful the black sprayed all over my desk while i was trying to install it .
zipper broke after a week and it says it holds a phone and all of your cards and stuff but it only hold one or the other do not buy
difficult to get hung right . the mounting clips spin around and come out . ended up mounting using velcro . would not buy again .
small parts are easily lost .
just not thrilled although i cannot pinpoint why . janeb
requires  ! aaa batteries or optional buy it separately ...! ac adapter to work at all . if you just buy this it is a paperweight .
love the color . it did not work for what i wanted it . it does not stay stuck on my plastic baskets .
it was okay
clinks against keys in my pocket
i like my brother printer however the cartridges need to be replaced way too often . but that is why these companies can sell cheap printers . they recoup their money on the cartridges .
scratches easily not the best quality .
runs out of ink fast
after about a month of use started leaving black streaks . not worth the aggravation get the genuine part from hp
sound quality not as good as my old panasonic system . no earphone jack
the chairmat is wonderful . it is a perfect fit and protect the carpet .
these ply mouse pads immediately began to separate . i do not recommend for anyone with other than infrequent use .
the liquid in this spray bottle was spill out all over other markers and other packages . the entire package complete soaking wet .
my daughter printed one time only and not work any more i am very angry because my daugher needed to print notes for school  .
complete junk uses way to much ink then stopped working within months . save your money and buy something other than an epson product .
this mount does not get tight enough to keep my projector from wobbling all around
well it certainly does what it is supposed to but so does the slightly smaller version sold at dollar tree . whaaa whaaa 
 wash and ruined
much too small will be returning
was okay
this sharpener was so quiet because it does not sharpen anything !
not as thick as i hoped for .
put in first set and they printed ran alignment and they worked as they were suppose to next is to find out life and if they keep working  !
i expected a fine point and what i got is a bold result .
misrepresented ! cost a fortune to make it into picture . i am stuck with two rolled up wax paper i cannot do nothing with
my bell does not ding as it should .
i had this wonderful printer for years until the paper carrier broke and canon do not make that piece anymore so this printer is obsolete if you can not find pieces to fix it .
do not recommend . i have to constantly reinstall and re link my computers and wireless devices .
not sure things were filled completely during their manufacturing process .
color worked just fine but black missed lines ....tried cleaning nozzles etc . but no difference ....new cartridge corrected the problem
these do not last very long good thing they are relatively cheap .
it works really bad
it is fine but did not work on my board . i do not know if it is the eraser s fault or the board though .
 out of cases were useless because two of the covers they sent were incompatible with the bases supplied .
i have tried everything and can not get these to work in printer that it said it would work for
too low my door swings right over them . definitely pay attention to the height of these stops and the space under your door .
buy the shredder oil when you buy this it works fine when lubricated but starts to stick after the rd use of pages without applying the oil .
it is not dark enough
well made but too thick to fit comfortably in my pants pocket .
do not waste your money . the first step sticker did not come off and bent the screen protector rendering it useless .
arrived broken ...never worked .
measurements are practically comparable to standard notebooks . i wanted a wider college ruled notebook .
these are good but they are kind of hard to put the credit card back into it every time .
sold as also ordered with printer does not fit this printer so had to reorder from another source when ink ran out could not print till delivered please check the also ordered crap
would not work in my lexmark printer .
i should have returned these while i could they are waxy and light .
fun product but the silver peels off and leaves sparkles on your clothes .
permanent crease in the middle but otherwise pretty cool .
this is the worst pencil ever . i teach school and i bought these pencils because i thought they were well made . lead falls out when you sharpen them . waste of money !
binder is not really all that heavy duty .
not very strong . anything more then pages slides out of the clip . does not hold sheets as stated .
good printer noisier than expected
these are to big expected smaller cannot wear with my bade to work expected more of a badge size
lasted a month
was good for awhile then broke .
copies are fuzzy and it does not reproduce in color as stated in various ads plus the the box portable color scanner 
there is no way this is rated for pounds . this is cheap and plastic is so thin that it bows when you put a monitor on it . wasted my money !
i have expected a large door stop that i can put in front of door to stop closing not the item i wanted
product arrived in excellent condition thank you
did not fit mdr like the page said .
it is my opinion that they are terrible !
i paid for quantities total and only got in the mail ! not good !
pencils that can not be sharpen are worthless . i tried different sharpeners and only of the set could be sharpened with out breaking the tip off before it had a point .

most uncomfortable pen i have ever purchased . ink is not smooth . size makes it easy to carry around otherwise zero stars .

does not work with windows 
cheap . letters are not fully printed . try something else .

bag is slightly too small .
no one else will understand .
worked great for a little while but now weeks later not working well at all the wifi is off does not work at all . only when you plug in .
had more of a leak problem when installing this cartridge . have used these for many years and this was a first . the sealer latch seemed to be less well made .
do not call it k if it cannot do k downscaling the native resolution does not count !!!
not happy trying to download from disc ask for serial number on case or pouch and thier is none tried to call place and just goes silent then busy not a happy customer
the labels are glossy and thick and as described ...but they are so thick it is impossible to print with my brother inkjet printer . jams every single time so ultimately could not use .

it sucks a lot of ink but if you want something really good you have to pay a big price for that . does what i need it to for now
this ink does not work with the mx canon printer . the printer will not recognized it .
runs out way to quickly for the price point .

loud ticking sound  !! still like it
you have to be genious to handle it properly after following manual i still cannot find right button to replay stop or delete .
it is cheaply made and easily broken
the old one was great but the one i received was not the one in the picture . they have changed the design .

bad quality printing from these . you get what you pay for .
these do not wipe off chalk boards easily . they are bright and bold though .
pretty colors . but the tips get mangled and smooshed from very little use they do not provide you with a nice clean line .
these are good for poster boards but not for coloring books as stated . plus for the price there are better sets made for coloring books .
nice for the 
has caller id but only shows phone not name otherwise fine
not table size . too small . falls easy .
i have had some fade and recently had to reload the full set because of quality issues . great price but think twice about using this for photo printing .
not as fancy as it being showed on the advertising .
can i return it and get a refund ? it is not working . like seriously ? it is not printing . nothing . i tried everything .
ok markers . i tried these once but i ended up preferring to buy metallic colored lolliz pens . the colors are metallic but not bright kind of drab understated no pop . janeb
purchased for an epson wf  . replaced the color cartridges immediately upon installation received error message that yellow and cyan cartridges were empty .
bought print quality no good have to replace
the ink isn n that much good
the description says it is for keurig machines leading you to believe that it is for all keurigs but that is not the case . these are too big for mine ..
it is quite bulky and not really worth it . also hard to fit the cables and the calculator itself in without having to stuff it in . not worth it .
the scanner does not work ... i am trying to connect via usb cable it prints and copies just fine . might scan via wireless but i do not have that capability .
cards are fun beautiful the envelopes look old ...
it did not seem to work with my in . oh well
these did not work in my epson xp the machine would not even recognize the cartridges .

broke within weeks of use

came with ink stains . not exactly clear . looks gray on white desk . returning .
it did not last even a whole month . the buttons stopped working .
the ink is okay but there is not enough of it in the cartridge to match the price i paid .
a little clumsy to put together you really need a third hand but serves its purpose .
adequate
i bought this a few weeks ago and it is already asking to be replaced !!
was much smaller than i was expecting and do not like how the envelope hooks are balancing the lid

do not waste your money did not worked !
box was damaged and taped .
kind of expensive .....think twice .
they serve the purpose but a little hard to open .

the print may be large but too few pages for me
good price but some do not stay latched .
hard to use
not reliable
very disappointed . keyboard disappears and you are unable to log in to your netflix account without a keyboard ! product does not come with manual . not user friendly at all !
not great but not the worst pencil sharpeners either .
the volume could be a little louder . other than that . it works okay .
this is the most unreliable printer ever created . i tried over and over to follow the troubleshoot directions and when i call brother you get no support and no real help .
standard cordless calculator . wish i knew how to use it better .
this cartridge seems to be ok . i do not print so many pages but it looks dark enough when i print .
nothing special
maybe once i get some better paper they will work w out scratching the paper ! they also kind of spray the ink on the downstroke .
plastic not glass poorly made
very disappointing . the covers wee the opposite of jumbo and did not come close to fitting my son s textbooks
not as sturdy as i thought but it works and so far has held up for years with constant use
wished there was more in the package
price was cheap but my printer has not worked right since i installed them . it will not print out anything blue and a photo i printed out was horrible . wasted my money !
it did not show to work as well as i had anticipated .
disappointed in the sound quality and the fact that there was no way to transfer data to a computer .
my printer did t accept this cartrige i have to do a procedure that i found in a youtube video to used

they were as expected .
the chain is very cheaply made the leather holder looked like a piece of thin cloth not satisfied at all
no bonus sharpie as described in ad . four pens instead of five

did not realize it was not an alligator clip . bummer .
cheaply made .

one new cartridge would not work . print said it was low on toner .
it was o .k my friend liked it .
possibly old . it ran out much quicker than my previous experience with this cartridge .
arrives with no instructions . now i need to figure it out . update cannot figure it out . i broke it . using the speaker for another project now .
print quality is terrible . it will not print if the printer has been on for more than minutes without having to turn it off and back on again .
was not what i was looking for
the size was not easily seen in the description of this item . unfortunately this was not the size i needed it does not hold a full sheet of paper .
 seller is having inventory issues this is an excellent pen one of my absolute faves i cannot live without . however the pack i ordered actually only had pen . well then ..
the lead would not even come out of the pencil when i bought the  . model i feel like i have been scammed .
it does not work
clinks against keys in my pocket
amplified but with very poor sound quality .
pictures are deceiving . this is a tiny neon like sign that you would see in businesses that say open  .
every time i walk past and step on the mat i end up hashing my foot on the edge . blood was drawn ...pretty disappointed . it did help my chair roll better though .
mine came without the magenta so my printer still will not work because it has to have all of the ink !
this fountain pen does not have a good quality as an expensive pen especially the nib that has a lower quality comparing to the previous model .
although advertised as a compatible replacement the plug on these batteries does not mate well with the phone .
it was broken and unusable upon arrival . i would have rated it a minus if there was that option . buyers beware
horrible this time . gel is messed up and super squishy and wrist sinks to had plastic underneath .
i really cannot rate this product because i have not yet used any of it . looks perfectly adequate however .
did not work . shut the projector off after seconds . i gave it an additional star because the vendor made the return easy .
lighter colors are to light to read .
not x 
cheap knock offs of famous knives . just awful quality clone . zero stars ! no more no less .
i sent this item as a gift to a friend and although she likes the design the finish started to peal off as soon as she picked it up .
definitely not what i was expecting . very flimsy and not well made . spend a few more dollars and do not waste money on this item .
too big stuck out of the binder
it does not move as easily as i would like
like the way it works but is so complicated when trying to change any of the settings instructions did not help much .
it all right
old . glue does not stick well
love the size and that you can not see through the envelope . my envelopes did not seal well so i have to add tape to seal when mailing .
not sure if the less actually rotates .
good product
worst than i expect those are really thin plastic sheet easy to tear off . the ink is easy to wipe out . i kept them because it is only few dollars .
lost the magnet the first day
clunky and the chain is really thick and hard to pull . also it is really short does not even reach the key pad while you wear it .
just awful . very disappointed the fabric is cheap and very frail and this was a waste of money .
did not work with my printer even though i followed directions .
mediocre printer but for the price it is ok .
not sharp so not easy to use
it connects to everything wirelessly and easilyhowever runs out of ink fast and ink is very expensive
the flash cards were printed with thin cheap paper . my son is a rough kid . these cards are not going to last . i have seen better thicker flash cards out there !
you will not get as much use as they say . we do not print even pages in a year and used up two of these in months ...
this item broke as soon as i used it !
i purchased a box the first two pens out of the box were dry . the next pen number is acceptable
the ringtones are obnoxious and the handsets are not very durable . i would not buy them again .
these bags have a cute pattern but the label has typos and makes absolutely no sense . i am annoyed that i spent money on these . i will not be using them .
not a good replacement . could not reset printer to ignore cartridge level . had to replace with real cartridges
ordered white but got gray . said white on package . do not trust colors .
shipped in awful form and device is banged up and not in good shape
the magnet is weak . slides off . does not hold so much as a cardboard badge let alone glasses . the diamonds are a paper cutout photo .
just your regular old accordion file ! quality is acceptable and just how i thought it would be . i would purchase this product in the future .
after installing the drum light came on and will not go out ??
a very short life span . i trashed the telephones .
i have had this for three days and one of the rings is already separated .
i do not know about other products from jwin but this one did not say it needed an ac adapter bateries wear down quickly
they work well .
still have background noise but only on occasion now . otherwise very good product .
did not fit the print at all
the only problem i have had with these is that if you have previously purchased and used a compatible ink brand and you only need to replace of the cartridges they will not work .
no big deal get the muji pens instead and spend your money elsewhere on highlighters . these are just fine no big deal .
worked okay for a few months and then broke . not worth the money .
when i pull out a sticky note a pair of two comes out at once . what is worng with them
did not work for my printer .
i had to keep taking the card out of it is slot to get this damn thing working . now it is not work working anymore .
broke days after it was delivered meaning no exchange ... solid concept poor quality will not buy again
product as pictured says recycled paper . what i received is marked as recycled paper  ... definitely a lesser quality mailer than pictured  ... 
lasted about days and already has broken sides .
worked great and much cheaper than wb mason or staples .
it is o .k
will not fit mm rolls and the design is printed on what looks like vinyl and the applied to the case . i will be returning this .
horrible
did not work at all !!!
does not support hebrew like stated
weak magnet . does not hold a cardboard badge let alone eyeglasses .
you can not beat the price not really suitable for presentations that require reading but for movies it is a win !
looks great but it does not stick to the magnetic board . it slides . thanks for amazon i got a refund
just about cheaper to buy a new printer for the price of the ink
this is an extremely cheap thin plastic pencil case . the zipper broke and the seam split upon first use .
technology works okay but the software is awful . crashes all the time and is really slow . i would buy it again but just know what you are getting into ...
very flimsy . collapses easily !
nice projector . the image could be higher resolution but over all not bad . the brightness is excellent .
they arrived quickly however i received five wide ruled books instead of the college ruled i was expecting .
most of the cartridges don tt work ! i have had incredible problems with this product . the epson workforce does not recognize the cartridge . wasted money !
you have to make a number of attempts for pull the paper and scan . poor quality scan most of the time .
it says right on the box its for a d but its not the air filter is completely different . what a waste .
it was horrible . the globe sticks to the top or bottom and does not float as advertised . total waste . i will never recommend this item to anyone . the worst .
it does not work . my printer will not detect it .
having a very hard time getting the felt pieces to stick to it . magnet is fine after it flattened out .
my printer would not work with theses cartridges . i had to end up buying epson brand cartridges for it to work .
cartridges failed to operate in my printer . printer did not recognize cartridges .
i thought this was a large wall calendar .. it was too small for my needs . otherwise its great !
hard to set up and the tray keeps falling off otherwise its lower in price than the rest and it still does the work
so inexpensive .
very cheap . would not buy again . i guess you really do get what you pay for .
instructions are horrible and misleading came with mismatched and missing parts and plastic tray is of poor quality . stay away !
i like the mailers but what is with the white dust all over them ?
cartridges did not work . giving error of either missing or damaged . useless ....
comes with fewer pieces of paper than thought .
it came broken
they work just fine and the price was great !! thank you
it looks a whole lot better on amazon than it actually is . and they are super tiny !
the cards that were supposed to be with the book were not even included for just more i could have got the book and the cards brand new and not used !
proven to not work well in our printer . runs out of ink too fast .
i really like the set mostly for the calendar but it shows sets of numbers . i did not see anything that said sided and i had plans for both sets .
this product does not work in the hp printer . the printer detects that is not hp ink and will not print . do not buy !!!!!!
it is too gigantic . i expected it way smaller than this so a lot of grocery bags could fit in densely . the quality was fine though . i will just use it .
this is not the photo black ink for a  . amazon put this in the also buy below some other ink and i did not look carefully enough . now i have to reorder .
does not hold up to constant use in industrial and dusty environments .
hard to get cards into the edges try to curl down inside
difficult to peel off paper to get to the rest of the eraser .
really aqward to use
phone did not charge with said batteries . useless .
it says it takes pages but stops with  . the drawer for the paper is difficult to close and when trying to close the whole shrdder tips over . not heavy duty at all
too small not worth the price . do not think add specified size
only had in the box not  . otherwise ok .
nothing to write home about but adequate enough for my needs . i was hoping for a sturdier binder though .
black seems to be okay ...other colors write very faintly . needed to replace a black one that lasted over months . hope these last that long .
the handset does not have speaker phone capability . will not be able to use it by the pool .
ordered two . pi fell off had to glue on
too small cannot put any money in it
dented when i received it . one of the two locks already broken .
definitely pretty . but very small .
tagging gun did not work . went to office depot to by one that worked fine .

lid does not fit top . useless .
black ink not blue ink  !!
got chipped in three places within first month . i am not aware i bumped into anything even slightly .
very poor quality looks like it was made at a home computer by a year old . words were smudged too . not even close to worth the money .
this is an older unit the new unit is more and could not cancel because of one day free shipping
do not buy this its so chsaply made it broke afyer a couple wees garbage
great gift for a wonderful manager but it does not work . need a battery . only good for looking at on the desk .
i opened the packages today none of the pens worked . i am not real happy about this .
it did not work and the instructions were only in spanish .
avoid at all costs . will damage your printer . i will be replacing a practically new printer because of these cheap ink cartridges .
it is a pretty planner . when i received it i really like the cover . the interior is standard planner so i feel like it is overpriced just for the design .
kind of cheap after a while
shortly after putting these in ink heads clogged up do not get this garbage
never again ! of the cartridges were dry and the last one lasted a day !!! what else can i say whiteout being  ......
one of the bows came out at the first try
quality poor does the job i imagine will not last long .
not goog
cheap . too big for a normal size binder and they all ripped . do not waste your money .
i bought this printer at costco in april and it is defective with a bad print head . they will only replace it with a reconditioned unit . beware !
not legit . does not work in the printer it says it works for . crap !!
a little water got on corner and the whole cover totally fell apart and faded the color . my lilly planner did not do this . really frustrated i only had his for days
awful !! the charging piece broke off inside my phone !! i was able to get it out by myself but it was really jammed in there . buyer beware !!!!!!!!!!
it works fine but you kind of have to mash the keys for them to enter the information . i guess smartphones have me spoiled .
the cartridges where not filled they were just half way or less . only got like prints out of one . smh .
worked for a short time but now my printer is ruined .
it slides on the wood floor . not the best . product not great but delivery was fast .
not really that sticky or strong .
frustrating to use not very flexible and difficult to use with paper in it .
misleading description . only comes in pack of books . not packs which is shown in picture .
two of the plugs out of five in the package were too large and i could not properly close the back cover of the phones . the three batteries which fit are working fine .
item was defective . canon shipped me a new one which works fine .
black ink cartridge was empty . will not waste my money buying again
love the minions but the attachment comes out of his head so what do you do ?
bulb blew out in a month ....
horribly cheap . the cork is not thick enough to actually hold a thumb tack you push it in and hit plastic and it falls out .
was not recognized by the printer
very thin paper
these toners are not new . they are refilled .
did not work i had to return it .
scale works great and the price was right .
not what i was expecting it is actually ugly . the picture on amazon is deceiving !!! the only thing i liked was the tin box . i returned the item .
black ink was fine but after inserting the color cartridges my printer still did not print color .
leaked the second i started writing with it and is not returnable . junk .
this is not sticking to wall . how are you going to hang this up ????
not as nice as the real deal from troika . the edges are sharp but overall it is good for the money .
you will pick nothing but wooden splinters from your teeth maybe useful for wood craft !
as described
when through my kindle and did not find this
the stamper works on some address labels others you can still see the mailing address .
had a lot of problems connecting to the wifi and ink would run out very quickly . the scanner was maybe the only good thing about it .....
mine arrived with no emoticons on any of my pens ... i received one of each color but the have no emote
they do not work in my printer
did not hold posters for the length of time i needed it to hold the posters . will not buy it again
i had the impression that these were self adhesive name plates when reading the description but they are not . i was disappointed !
i only use the ink times and its run out not good
the black printing ink did not work at all after a few prints .
cheap product . not very good even for  .  . this company sucks . do not buy anything from these guys . cheap products .
not very durable and tends to weigh on the low side .
these pens are not in the same class as pilot or pentel . they are cheap . the ink skips and globs . they belong in the rubbish they are nothing but trash .
gave as a christmas gift and is already coming unglued .
this is a nice planner . i like the way it is laid out but it is way too small for practical purposes .
does not work . main base unit will not even power on .
i have tried the first color cartridge and it is only yellow and blue no red !!! if the other three are like this first one this is not worth my money !!!
not as sturdy as i thought they would be .
color cartridge lasted weeks . have yet to put the black in my machine . printer is not working now till i get another color cartridge .
these are just bleach tablets . now my bathroom smells like a bleach factory .
good color and coverage but depending on how you hold pens the nib can be a little hard painful to hold . i like them though !
i thought the calender would be on heavier paper very flimsy was not pleased  . arrived on time .
i do not have man hands but my hand swallows this pen . no great shakes i am going to .
i was hoping for a sturdier binder but it is adequate enough for my needs .
binders look cheaper than the usual avery quality . some of the binders bindings are splitting .
they look good i will have to see how they print and tear but i think they will do the job . the price was reasonable .
color and copies look good however paper does not feed easily and needs a stack of paper to recognize that paper is in the tray .
it would have been perfect if it had not come in bent . we will need to return it .
not dark enough even when pressed harder !
i was expecting them to stick a little better . they are more like a post it adhesive .
does not fit right and it is bigger than original so none of my cases fit with it on . plus it is pink not red . very dissapointed .
what i expected but the paper is flimsy .
like the prints and seemed durable . but they were too small and did not fit any of my th graders textbooks .
board arrived and appeared to have been shipped damaged . the board was bent and the calendar was not adhered to the board . did not really seem like great quality .
it supposed to have two screws but i only got one . i think originally it has already missed .
these ink cartridges were not recognized by my printer .
lousy copier . file this one under you get what you pay for  . but hey it is cheap .
broke with days of use . the different pens get stuck and out of line . just invest in uniball or inkjoy
please note these are mini pegs not normal sized for clothes . i made the mistake of buying these for clothes but they are so tiny it could only peg photos .
too tiny for my needs .
spine on first one used ripped . not as sturdy to use over and over .
the pen works fine but i do not like how loose the middle is .
doent hold key well birds keep coming out
stopped working after a page document 
oops i should have read the reviews i ordered this to start using now in august but it does not start until january 
seriously disappointed . the top does not fit the box . see photo . do i send it back ?
ok china trash ...
i bought this to be a speaker for our projector . it is okay but i would have preferred louder . it will still be used just not for movie or football game watching .
the hair comes off too easily . i cannot go anywhere with out leaving a trail of poof hair .
only different types of cards .. and of each ! not much variety
the black ink was fine however the color would not work ....
it got unpacked . the edges crumpled . the label with my name glued in the plastic product . now i have to make a package to send it back . no more comments .
my printer does not read them as full . they work fine i just get tired of the low ink warnings
was not a magnet at all ! just a sticker !
piece of junk . arrived with the spring not attached fixed that . then it would not close . had to order a different stapler .
this had a lot of distortion without a lot of amplification . lots of air sound in the background . i do not recommend .
worst speak phone on the planet continually cuts out with zero background noise . other than that the phone works fine just do not expect to ever have a conversation on speaker phone .
quite insulted that someone thinks this is a mousepad for women .
did not fit my pen
not fine enough
they moved the side the wire was on this made it a little harder to install in the tight battery compartment in the phone .
my printer would not recognize these at all . sending back .
did not like it
cheaply made metal tabs that hold the board in place were broken and the frame is loose and wobbles . very disappointed and would never purchase again !
linkyo compatible toner cartridges replacement ...
never did get the hang of using this like a regular tape dispenser . if i did it still would not justify the price .
awkward to use caused computer freeze ups
pencils make alot of dust when coloring with them
only got in the mail product is good though .
page in the users manual states  .... never to ring you again . this is not true . a blocked number will indeed ring once . you should correct this misinformation .
no the card and envelope arrived damaged and i returned it for a refund .
a little watery but ok .
good idea just wish the points where a bit sharper .
you basically have to have this up to your eye and on top of whatever you are trying to look at to see it .
pease of crap
the . tv . is . only box . or . is . the . tv complet
the wood is definitely on the cheap side of the spectrum but it gets the job done .
faxing is a bit un user friendly display window is difficult to see
no loops for the shoulder strap
it is too heavy for me but it writes very smooth .
it did not work well . it was almost dry and flow of ink was very poor
please do not order these catriges they do not work . i spend money it was not worth it .
its toner really
i really like this pen . i recently bought one and it ran out of ink already .. did not even have it long . so sad !
this has no functional use at all they are simply a prop .
not as sharp as i thought but the scissors do the job .
cartridges did not work in printer .
the calendar came and it was green regular green not sky blue .
poor sound quality
the sound is not up to standards programming it has been difficult
i expected the color of the pages to be approximately the same as the cover but it was so light it just appeared to be a dirty white color .
okay quality . color is a bit off . late delivery !! uncool !!
i did not buy this . wrong person .
these are not compatible with mfc j w they do not fit !
did not work so disappointing
arrived damaged
love the design but claps are cheap and broke already
too much black . was hoping for more colors .
the black cartridge does not print at all after one week  ... i am using the exact model for my printer and the printer says it is full  .... very disappointed
hard to separate without tearing
received bent and not laminated
they were empty when i got them a complete ripoff do not buy
overpriced and very flimsy ...one would have hoped for a sturdier envelope .
these do not work for panasonic model kx tga  . yeah the disclaimer says most panasonic phones i get it . but still . buyer beware .
product description says per pack and image is of pens but i only recieced one pen . very misleading .
i received all broken glass
sucks !
poor packing little to no padding . broken when it got to me . oh well live and learn
i only printed few sheets but the black ink ran out very quickly . i am very disappointed .
hungry hungry sharpener really loves colored pencils . it is plastic which i did not expect and the way it opens makes a wall mount pretty messy but it does sharpen things .
this is a terrible !!!! company !! very misleading and a total ripoff !!! i expected book covers and only got one !
is a pain in the neck to during ink refill process . the body do not stay well attached to the head . ink flow is terrible .
banding across page fine ink splatters too much bleeding not really acceptable .
i thought they had on and off switches 
lasted only months before not working ..... you get what you pay for i guess ....
who sells a weekly planner that is a year out of date ? better yet who buys a planner a year out of date ?
ink only worked for about days then it started printing only half the page for each paper .
too slippery
this item was to gat on the  ?
little bit hard my hands are chubby !!
i purchased one of these and my calculator literally started smoking ! i am lucky it did not toast my calculator but i would stay away .
they worked . but do not have a lot of printing capacity . i got through pages before my computer told me that my ink cartridge needed to be exchanged .
does not really work as described at all
who in their write mind would even pay for a pencil pouch this is just ridiculous . i would never buy one for that price even if it was the last one on earth .
it flawlessly does what it is supposed to do ... easy to use but has a very flimsy termination and it does not come with batteries .
i did not read carefully enough . these do not fit quickbooks statements only business size checks .
this is and ok product cheap quality no as good as advertized but it works for the price
took forever to come in and once it did both pieces were the same . two hearts no key it would cost more to return than i paid .. junk
tv picture is not as vivid 
works in my old printer .
i paid more for this product but i received a low quality plastic filter screen
i was able to break into it using nothing but my hands after it was incapable of being opened after it failed to save my combo ...do not buy .
disappointed . two of the sets were open and spilled all over the box and each were missing two markers . only markers in two of the packs .
i just cannot see anything rip off
great product but picture is inaccurate you only get pencil and the packing is not great because the pencil tip was broken when it arrived at my house .
broke with in a few weeks
plastic material .
product is fine but the box arrived smashed in on one corner with all the tips broken off of the pencils .
the first one i replaced did not last too long about months and then i had to replace it !
warning ! warning ! these pads are sized for an ant colony ! this is not clear enough in the description . should read tiny notes !!!!
did not fit my ink cartridge and it was listed that it would .
not much air for the money
i did not get the pcs as advertised i got  . this came directly from china . still cheap for pcs . i will not order anything that comes directly from china again .
good for storage but not for moving . too lightweight .
is ok .
i wish the tabs were not all on the same side but other that that a pretty good product !
the worst ! you expect staplers to sometimes jam etc . but this product was a piece of junk from day one and never functioned as advertised .
xl capacity ink ? i think not ! even on efficiency mode with my printer i only got photos before these were empty . worst waste of money in my life .
these cartridges are not working right in my hp opfficejet pro printer . the colors do not come out even after cleaning and aligning of heads .
it was the wrong thing . did not need this
horribile . messed up my printer .
ink does not last long at all
do not buy !!! i bought these to use as food labels for a birthday party and the sticks do not even fit into the pre made hole in the stand ! very disappointed .
exactly what i expected .
i was disappointed that of the crosses were misshapen . it was going to cost me more to return the items than they cost originally including shipping . i expected better .
did not work right cartridge faild
smaller and lighter than expected .
well considering that it was covered in shampoo when i received it i initially was not happy . then realized this binder is not the same quality as the one pictured .
corners were bent and had blimishes
too small return item
they smear everything i try to highlight in my textbook .
the blue ink cartridge will not work for us . we needed the black so badly though we decided to not return it .
too small !
had a white stain on it . tossed it out ...
nice quality but holes in binder do not match standard daytimers refills .
overpriced and does not last long
very cheaply made . came with a dead battery in the transmitter and one of the finders did not work . when replaced still did not work . please do not buy .
quality was good shipment good multicolor ... bad . white the rest cooper color no assortment !!!
returned the unit . scan resolutions were fast with great resolution . but the device is impossible to color calibrate such that every scanned color transparency requires extensive correction in photoshop
extremely flimsy chain broke the first day i had it in several pieces . feels like its made of aluminum .
no it did not
too small quality very poor
most of the cartridges don tt work ! i have had incredible problems with this product . the epson workforce does not recognize the cartridge . wasted money !
work as expected . caller id is a little hard to read
when i used them they were great .
its cheap for the price . the quality of the product is not good
not really easy to set up for use .
i had trouble sealing the envelopes in the last two boxes i bought .
it does not work . i want a refund .
i only received battery packs on my order for  ?
the bristles became misshapen the very first time we used the brushes .
found these a bit rickety but all in all i have repurposed them . seller was a good shipper
inferior planner for dollars worst shopping experience i have so far
the colors were faded !
pen is fine . i like the way it writes but the ink supplied for the pen is not dark at all . i am really disappointed .
received bent and it is not laminated .
the planner i received was purple . this was not one of the listed colors .
hard to assemble . cannot seem to snap in the end pieces .
it looks like a scaled down version of an old woman s cigarette case . it could have been cool but the leather is an ugly caramel poop brown .
i am short and did not need it . not using it .
the only red binder i could find but when we got it it def was flimsy .
not a good fit for sony tv you need to spend extra  .
fax ribbon was never replaced
their return policy is unfair . my phone died before thirty days and they closed my dispute . beware the reconditioned phones !
the sheets are thinner than expected . other than that it is basic paper .
the field of view is extremely short at the lowest magnification and even worse at the highest . also the lens do not align properly for viewing an object .
bought and broke easily . returned both and the seller refunded me .
not mfi apple certified . hit and miss on working . do not buy .
the quality not acceptable at all
item came as described but took a really long time to arrive .
not what i expected . snap does not stay close . waste of my money . hate it !
too fine for a smooth writing .
this had such a strong plastic chemical odor that i could not keep it . also the lid does not latch down and the handles are kind of awkward .
the origin of the erasers was stated as malaysia but when they arrived the erasers were made in china .
arrived in time to send it with my daughter to college . battery is dead so she has not been able to use it and is missing out on daily points ........ very disappointed 
pretty sure the wood dowels are not suppose to pop out the top . looks bad .
i have had to throw away of these pens because the ink flow is either erratic or non existent . i do not recommend them . the pilot g retractable is a better pen .
its a waste box no big deal
first batch of ink did not work . ld sent replacements that worked fine then clogged the print head .
does not work . sending it back .
ok not use yet but looks like it could do the jobs i do
it is way more complicated to use than i had expected .
this tape did not separate properly leaving a black film on the yellow tape .
very poor quality out of the box . dark lines on every third page .
these are just okay . they are hard to keep on your fingertips . i got through what i needed to do using them but would not buy them again .
cheap looking and did not print well at all .
smaller than expected ...plus some images were disturbing to my year old ..not a good buy for us .
cheap but works well limited options too it can only one song forward at a time . was worth the few dollars i paid for it .
color cartridges did not work finally got black to work after trouble shooting
by stretchy materials they do not mean dry fit . but still better than any other transfers i have tried .
took forever to receive it . looks very cheap . zipper broke after one week of use . not worth it
these refill are ok not much to say about them i do recommend them .
expected a bound type engagement agenda desk calendar rather than the single page toss one i received . my error the item lacks a real description of itself .
the top stitching was poorly done . i would have returned it and ordered a new one but they had no more and i needed a guest book right away .
the pen was dried up and unusable .
ths mag glass is a piece of junk  !  ! it falls apart and is not even worth one star  !  !  ! dvl
it do not work
not compliant with my printer 
bracelet already broke beyond repair . i ve only had it around a month . while i did have it i got quite a few compliments .
item was not complete i only got pouches total rip off !!!
why did i have to buy this so soon
pretty sure these are actually those mosquito repellant bracelets ... they smell like citronella .
it was smaller than i expected .
do not buy these . these are short and thin .
meh .. seems like the ink is watered down ... the lifespan of the ink is very short meaning have only printed about a dozen sheets and now the cartridges are almost empty .
the price on the actually planner states  . and it was much smaller than i intended .
was not happy at all because of the price i did not see a need in sending it back .. every color was excepted into my printer except the yellow .
does not print clearly . rarely use it yet it never has ink ? i would recommend that you not buy this machine .
the sticky stuff doe snot stay on anything . waste of money spent
they need to be more specific as to what printers are adaptable for these cartridges . they do not fit all esp office printers .
cannot use cartridges at all they are not and they are a and a so i cannot get them into my printer .
sadly these are cardboard backed and they warp easily as did all the ones shipped to us 
tips were not micro ...did not last long at all before skipping ........
the ink does not come out of the pen regularly so writing is frustrating . i do not use them anymore .
did not work on my printer .
my needs had changed was not able to cancel item
had to do my own collating !!
so far the yellow works but the neither one of the cyans are recognized . have to buy more ink now .
ran out of ink very quickly . not as good a value as i thought .
brand new out of the box and the ink already is not bold on each number ! it looks faded and does not correctly print each number !
did not hold posters for the day period for which i needed to use it . will not buy it again .
way too small for practical every day use .
the edge of the note was bent but i just accept this condition .. since i have to use for my lab work ..
horrid . first time it came bent and missing pieces . second time came still missing pieces !
it is seriously super cheap ...feels like cardboard with some zippers . also mine came slightly ripped ! i do not think i will even bring it .
would like the handsets to indicate by blinking light when a message is left . have to look at the base to see this .
would not buy this again . my printer has not printed well since i got it . very poor quality .
terrible !!! bought for my sons locker and it will not even stick without anything hanging from it ! stay away from this expensive hook !!! what a joke  ! now stuck with it  !
would not focus . led offers dim image at best . worst projector i have ever used . we returned it .
shreds pretty slow set time aside if you have a lot of shredding .
very unhappy with this product and service
cool mug but universal studios does in fact have it for on their website
wireless part very glitchy as mentioned in other reviews it is impossible to keep the cover from slamming down on your hands .
does not stay connected . very frustrating .!
not as cool looking as i would hoped but still a great pen .
quality not that great for the price . i kept it because i needed it .
was disappointed . the cards are rather thin flimsy . also far too many keep calm post cards .
these are not d . cheap looking cards . returned .
gave to school
font size is kind of small hard to read . otherwise nice product
speaker phone stopped working very quickly and the display stopped working as well . terrible phone .
the string snaps too easy i bought two and both strings snapped .
only one would work as advertised
it bends and breaks after a few days using
was not overerly impressed not like what i would expect from m
great price .
colors are completely different in real life .
scissors are very dull
it did not seem that smooth to me it is writes fine but i was expecting more .
i love my ti inspire ...but this one you cannot use on any standardized tests such as act sat and others
you will not be able to see the tabs if you use it with clear sheet protectors . money wasted .
it did not work
like the cups these leak but they are super cute and a good size .
these folders are very thin and flimsy .
the pin was perfect but the advertised bonus was not sent .
fit nicely . good service but pricey !
very flimsy . not nearly as good as other protectors i have bough .
work great for a day but then they dry up .
waste of money ! stick with name brand ...
it broke after a week fire button broke off a lot
too expensive for what it is
there really good because i prefer smaller ones it is just cards for like dollars and it probably should be dollars
the product looks to be well made but is not a standard size notebook . it is much smaller and will most likely not last me through the semester . a little disappointing .
it fell apart after the second use .
wrong charger .
i loved this at first because it is nice to choose your point but it is a little bulky for my bag and the top keeps popping off spilling the shavings .
does not lock . great for printed material . not great for anything bound .
terrible lasted only pages nd cartdrige gave error and did not work i will not buy this brand again
it sealed when i received when i open it it is not original i do not know how it last but it works
on the listing it says these are x x but they are much smaller .
pretty fun to mess with but the middle part where the two halves connect was rather weak resulting in a bend .
a little to big and the clip breaks too easily . just unnecessarily long as well .
two came damaged and dried out
does not work on lexmark  . gives error message to remove tape but there is no tape on it .
i know it said variety of binders .. i was hoping for the flowers ....i loved the flowers but got some other design that was not cute .
ink cartridges would not go in properly . sent machine back .
not as good as the brand name that is for sure
cannot give a view until i have had an oportunity trial .
this product does not work for the canon printer as stated in the description . it is useless .
my printer refused to work because would not recognize it .
two out of four that i ordered came broken . one was even clearly pre used as it came with pencil shavings .
the item is a crayon and not a marking pencil . i would still like to buy a brown marker .
they did not work .
my lexmark printer has thoroughly frustrated me .. i would not recommend this brand .
very good . have had them for many months now no issues . edit no longer hold charge . worked fine for months but lose charge hold over time .
we bought this to refill my husband s pilot frixion ball color ballpoint pen black body p lkfb ef b but it does not fit .
do not like it flimsy and does not hold much paper
perfect size . the ring is sturdy . much nicer in real .
basic colored copy paper . my only complaint is that the plastic wrapper around both reams i ordered arrived ripped open . paper was not crumpled or creased luckily .
not working in printer only epson ink will work
i have bought several of these but looking for an alternative . they pop open and spill out contents if you drop it . needs a different locking mechanism .
smells weird
so far so good !
it says wireless and even shows wireless but it is corded
my epson printer rejected one of the cassettes and prints poorly with the other .
good for price
this was terrible send it back send it back do not hook up came in a lot later than i was supposed to not pleased at all
i would probably like it more if i could scan wirelessly . seems ok so far .
envelopes are sturdy but very difficult to stuff it is hard to separate the insides to put anything in them .
barely got half the ink usage out of it . will not buy again .
really good did everything i needed it to
to much money
it arrived broken . the rings were all bent up . no bueno .
good scissors however no better than some of the cheaper ones that i own .
was broke before we even got it together . quality is poor . instructions are poor . tried to fix it but not worth it . refunded ...
let dry completely on chalk labels first
does the job but i would like a slightly deeper and wider unit so that manila envelopes and papers fit through the slot more easily .
its ok
buy the bigger size . yes it is more expensive but i had to replace this one a lot sooner than i had expected .
broke the first day . very poor quality
they stop working pretty quickly . not sure if i am doing something wrong . i moved on to the signo and have not looked back
stopped working after days
my printer has not worked correctly since putting these in .
does not print . has never printed a clear page since i have purchased it .
did not work and i waited too long to return
this is cute but the binding is soooo close to the edge of the paper that all of my sheets are ripping out . super disappointed with the quality of this .
the material is not so good but serves the purpose
not bpa free
these were supposed to be pens . so what happened to my pens ???
not as sturdy a product as projected but okay for my use . in the hands of children i do not see this lasting very long .
screws break easily no instructions poor costomer service . do not buy !
this is the nd time these charges only work for a week then they die ..
was lead to believe there would be three . only got one and was very small but nonetheless it is very sturdy and nice looking .
let us see how it works if i need it .
the red tray was labeled nickel with the sizing of the penny if anyone does not understand the color identification of coin they are going to be confused 
this was never recognized by my printer . it did not work .
some of the colors do not show up .
it is recycled ink . do not be fooled
the green tape crumbled inside jammed the machine .
teeny tiny spaces to write on .
awful ! do not buy . paint job terrible it arrived late and to much money . do not buy you can make this better by going to michael s .
meh feels like the smaller links could rip off if they were to catch on something and a little force were applied .
has a vibrant and distinct odor . i left it outside for three days until the smell went away
do not use this without a stand the optics are good and do the job .
the print tone is very low with a brand new cartridge .
does not melt keratin glue at all which is the reason why i bought it .
i did not like the quality . the alligator clip is spinning so it does not look right . i should return it ..
 to small
paid an it person dollars and it took him over an hour to install . there was a problem the rd time i had to print
terrible product . erasers break off very easily . total waste of money . will need to replace .
they tore at the seams almost immediately . not worth the money
did not connect to phone automatically if i stepped out of house and came back in . sync took almost mins everytime .. so not worth the time and money
magnet fell . off in one day poor quality
this item was purchased new . when i installed it the printed pages were smeared and toner residue throughout the pages . very disappointed in this product .
not sure how this got stars product is made poorly and nothing is labeled . how much can some stickers with letters coast ?
would not recommend them . they are cheap and break very easily .
black one leaked toner everywhere . still worth it for the savings on the colored toner but would not take the chance again .
these would not work in my printer . the printer did not recognize the cartridge as a new one and so they are of no use to me .
i love my new planner but the cover is already de laminating . i was hoping it would last longer than a couple of weeks as it is very beautiful
useful good size but second drawer does not open smoothly .
affordable compared to kinks or staples
these work well . no bleed through on thinner papers . but they do not last . just not worth the price for me .
ink leaks .
very cheap looking looks cute in the pictures . when i went to put them together it was a poor again ..cheap set up .
will not stay on cloth
printer does not recognize as being true hp replacements printer would not align cartridges . went and bought hp brand . printer works fine now
sticks to itself on the roll and does not tear readily
have not tried it but i s a good idea
worked well
i want a refund now ! i opened the box and it is empty . i desperately need those stamps . i am so furious .
it does exactly what it is supposed to do . it should pay for itself in a year or so since the label maker i bought it for goes through batteries pretty fast .
cheaper than most . paper arrives damaged at the corners causing ink to smear .
i hate pink erasers they do not work but they were on my son s school supply list .
product is fine but be aware it is for only folder and not a box of as originally sorted . price is well in excess of norm do not buy this !
had to return first shipment because of leakage
it is junk . i would put this more in the range . it is not comparable to other floor mats i own .
terrible product . the two batteries i bought only lasted months .
blue one was perfect  ! the red one was falling apart already when i opened it ! not happy !
very nice . just the right size .
i ordered this pack of assorted mirrors and only received one mirror ! not satisfied at all
not worth the money . it will not stay together . handle piece is very loose .
small post it notes with a big price . not worth the price .
i am extremely disappointed ! i received roll of toilet paper . the description clearly states rolls in the order . and that i had a savings of over a hundred dollars .
the worst product . difficult connecting . toner ran out too soon . not recommended !
i do not like this at all and waited to long to return it or i would have .
product arrived broken trying to use it anyway
dries up easily . cannot be compared to parker quink . will try to get colours in parker .
dry . worked for a day . i requested replacements but never received them .
does not work
none of the cartridges would work in my epson like it said it would this is a jip do not but this crap .
they broke in days !
the cover was kind of flimsy compared to other brands i have purchased in the past . other than that it does what it is intended to do .
good sometimes ...unreliable . for the price it is ok . good seller and fast shipping
this pencil sharpener worked very well at first . however over the past weeks it is becoming dull . would not purchase again .
it is a ok item for dollars . i was frustrated when i open the box . bad deal .
too small of a roll you through away the last because it is too curly
totally useless
fancy printer that flows ink like the mississippi clumsy wifi set up and bluetooth that is more sensitive than a hungry newborn . communication errors abound .
takes forever to charge do not even use them . very disappointed .
flimsy and a piece of crap
this sucks they are no better then the old ones
they are pens
these are poor quality folders the red one is so faded it almost looks pink .
so expensive
reliable for keeping your paper file separated .
not as sturdy as i would have liked but it works .
does not completely fit my phone and my cards are really hard to fit in as well
had alot of problems with this batch streaking etc
bad quality board bent and not sturdy  . will be returning the product .
cartridge was empty !
had them almost weeks and they came off the cabinet already
ink cartridge was half way and did not even print
you must use alcohol wipes before mounting especially in wet environments .
made my keys a little bulkier and a lot heavier .
too bad there is not a zero star rating . there must be a short because it cuts in and out . completely unacceptable . what a waste of money .
the box itself met my expectations . unfortunately it is not very sturdy and cracks chips easily not making it a good option for a trade show booth .
ink worked fine but color cartridges ran out extremely fast . color was going down even while i was printing only black white .  ???
add appears to have you recieve of these . if i knew i was paying all that for one i never would have bought it  !
great quality
new calculator arrived with a paper jam
sometimes they work sometimes they do not . my canon mx has decided that the blue cartridges large black are not compatible .
if you want to print package envelop labels do not buy this unit . addresses print so small that a magnifying glass is required .
not what i expected only paid  . so not too worried about it but good for the price
it does not sparkle that much . looks plastic cheap .
so flimsy it could not even hold up a lightweight small canvas !!! so dissapointed .
canon printers will not recognize these .they will work but you do not know when they r running low
did not fit properly without modification to the cartridge . was not making solid contact and was showing as disconnected
useless .
excellent but only for smallish books .
missing parts .... very upset  .... part number a  ..most ever in the box
i do not know what happens with electronics . at first i thought these were good . but after a month s use they are not working .
low quality
did not know they were sheer .
rope pylled out of plastic end with easiest of pull .
the magnet is very weak so it falls of often
had to return because it was missing the gas lift . would not recommend buying if you are going to get an open box item .
it is a warranty . i will know more if i have to make a claim .
purchased before worked great ...this time one leaked when installed ruined furniture .
the printer would not recognize the refillable cartridges .
this is very costly you get the same in staples for cents each which is way less .
performed and recieved as expected
when it came there was marks all over the pencil and the eraser was half gone . do not buy this pencil 
kept coming apart after about a week . had to tape it on the side so my i .d . would not slide out . other than that i would have really liked it .
all were for the left hand and fit awkwardly at best for the right hand . would be great if my kid was left handed .
complete crap ! i have never been more disappointed . what a waste of money !
battery charges and after correcting the header pinout for my fluke scopemeter  ... the meter can determine the battery voltage .
do not buy it .....failed very quickly ...ordering original brother drum today ...
epson tech support has not got a clue what they are doing . four hours is way too long to have conversations with them and still not have issues resolved .
listed our printer model number to be used with however it did not fit
toners seem not brand new . of toners are leaking . bad quality .
solid wood but not properly constructed not worth 
it is much too large .
i love this pen but the threading in side the main housing came unglued and i had to glue it back together .
horrible ...none of the pens would write ...ink all dried out ....
really does not work that well ...made too cheaply .. 
there is no january  !
these are each so two of them is only  . for worth of product . hmmmm
not easy to read
they do not fit in the printer right .so i went to the store and bought new which work
after a few weeks the clasp began to open at inconvenient times often spilling the papers all over . so i am now buying something else .
when i received this item it was refills and not reminder tiles . i am still looking to buy reminder tiles but this description was misleading .
 ...grossly poor handset cord . stiff as a board . is of flat construction not round . could not give them away ...
its beautiful but i wish they made for green parakeet too 
i have had them for almost a month . they all have out . i went and bought a charger straight from apple themselves . not worth my money big regret .
no use
cheap thin paper but it works .
box came completely ripped and clips all over the place .
it is ok .
junk junk junk waist of 
could only use about of the cards
loud s l o w and big ! you get what you pay for .....
small but gets the job done .
not that hard as i thought . it may be good on the hard floor .
get the r if you plan to use on large lcd tv screens this will not show up . it does flip powerpoint and pdf pages remotely which is nice .
use to distribute keys to new door locks .i like ability to write in name and phone number .
the ink is way to expensive and it always clogged up
not what i would consider heavy weight . looks nice but they seem too light to send through the mail .
small and cheap feeling .... my smartphone is sturdier
this does not work on the new printers do not buy it if you have a newer epson
did not work seemed to be empty both of them notpleased
the ink spilled all over the place . it is even spilled out all in my machine .
none of these worked .
i am going to return the cane . it came scached on one of the parts of the shaft . my husband got it for my birthday he was more disappointed than i was .
i have a iphone and unfortunately it does not work with my phone 
adhesive is weak . does not stay attached to whatever you apply it to .
when the refill was taken out of the foil bag ink was everywhere . the cap had loosened enroute so where gloves when you open it .
wrong part
had a few postcards returned in the mail all scratched up on the glossy side . opted for a textured matte finish for all my future mailings .
very disappointed with the quality . within week of these grips being on pencils they split and break in half .
did not help with my isue so picture was decieving
received empty ink cartridges 
terrible . the ink ran out so fast it was ridiculous .
my printer does not register the ink cartridge as being in the printer and thus i can only print in black white . very disappointing .
cheap quality
too small to read chinese character
these grips did not work for me . i went to adjust them on the pencil and they tore apart . would not recommend .
eats ink slow feeder poor . got rid of it .
guess it does the job for school was not thrilled at having to buy something like this but it works and is reliable .
it is no where near hd it almost seems pixelated .
cartridges do not work on my epson printer .
you have to have an engineering degree to get this sucker to work gave up and trashed it
this product did not work slowly came off the of surface and the fabric . luckily amazon having the good customer service that they have took the items back .
protege bien pero no s sostienen
magnets are falling out enclosure is not top quality as advertised
they donot get dark enough
not sure but this did not work in my phone . not worth sending back .
sending this back . poorly made and not large enough for my purposes .
something is wrong with this cartridge . it does not fully seat in the printer so i had to wedge a piece of cardboard between it and the printer to hold it in place .
the printer sees these as being used and does not recognized them as being filled but the ink quality is good enough .
what a rip off ink does not flow properly and the print is not always legible . stay away
these printers are awful ! the ink is expensive and they jam easily .
good pen writes well with a good ink . skips more than others and sometimes hard to start ...
its not as strawberry blonde as the picture as i had hoped and the bangs are rather long but it is nice and long and has a natural looking color
cheap chinese crap !!!! defective and poorly constructed
a bit expensive
wish they had lined version .
i was expecting a larger picture other than that i was pleased
very ruff !
better than folding s of pages by hand but it gets jammed and when they come out they do not stack up right .
awful . makes a big hole but does not hold papers together so i will stick with staples .
love the colors and concept of these highlighters but they smudge ink really easily .
the clasp that holds your badge and key broke a few days after use . the beads pinch the back of neck .
does not meet pb specs . our printer no longer works . voided the pb warranty .
sucks i printed one sheet then said was empty
i ordered this and received it ... but it does not have the mount with it .... so no use to me . i will have to send back .
this twine was fairly thin and broke under tension . it would certainly be fine for crafts .
corner on backrest tore through in less than weeks
do not buy this product ...it is so expensive given there is no difference with other educational posters ...what a waste of money ....
i am really disappointed . i am finding an old plastic sharpener better .
the idea was fine but it does not work properly . the tape keeps coming off .
was purchased for a gift after only using it for week s it did not close anymore .
kind of pricey but hp products lure you in on the initial price then nail it to you for accessories and repairs .
the plastic check duplicate divider is too short and not quality enough
battery did not charge up junk
total crap ! colors were wrong and did not print for more than a week . spend the money and buy factory .
received on time but not what is shown in picture . these are chinese nock offs . i installed one and it seems to be working so far .
the printing quality after i installed this cartridges is horrible . do not buy this .
i purchased black and color cartridges and of the black cartridges did not work . is there anything i can do to get this resolved ?
it works but cuts out a lot and clicks constantly . with a good bluetooth speaker you can barely hear it but for  . it is fun to watch stuff on my wall .
does not operate as smoothly as the hp printer i had before . requires more attention .
ok ...but too big and bulky .
the labels are not properly cut and taped together in sections worst thermal labels i have ever received . do not purchase
does not work on lexmark  . gives error message to remove tape but there is no tape on it .
that is fake and crazy the real price of st lm cost only and tb ssd which is triple faster than this cost  .
i am sure there are good intentions with this product however they are just hard to minipulate your credit cards in and out of the sleeves themselves .
the pens look awesome feel great in your hand but the ink refill is absolutely horrible . the ink starts and stops all the time .
had to end up hard wiring it . wireless would not work .
these do not work in my printer bought new at store that work .
product came and seemed like it was used . wrinkled creased folded corner and dirty . if it was clean and new it would be perfect . still usable but just disappointed .
calculations are wrong poor instructions inconsistent results
the inserts for credit cards fall apart easily .
it worked great at the first then printed all blank paper . this product has big problem to compatible with mac  . waste money .
the dial pad is great but the headset is a flimsy piece of trash . had to but another headset
really good did everything i needed it to
these labels jammed our printer . thinner quality compared to other brands .
lamp does not fit my wd  . do not waste your time . i purchased a genuine philips replacement and it fit like a glove .
did not wash off from chalkboard . dissappointed .
garbage does not work with ink jet printers crisp images that never dry regardless of what side is printed on
great when you need it
cannot hear clearly with this . so i just took it off . disappointing . wasted  .  .
great cutter but the ribbon curler does not work that great . i rather use a side of a pair of scissors because it works better and faster .
no comment
we have not used it yet . it seems to be cheaply made . only one side extends .
it can barely cut two pages at once and every page comes out crooked . very disappointing for a brand new paper cutter .
did not detect in my brother mfc j dw . had to return .
real junk  . very cheap handle is way too long for blade . total disappointment
the labels are quite small and difficult to write on legibly . the labels do not fit in the holders by themselves .
i do not like the box .
it is nice but i was looking for something one or two grades more industrial . this one can only do one page at a time
batteries do not last more that a few hours .
garbage ! will not order these paper thin bags again . sending back .
the printout from this ink is a little on the light side . it is not as dark and sharp as i am used to seeing .
practically doa out of the box .
dead on arrival . lights up but no display .
ink leaked
the eraser arrived damaged ...
had to return because it quit working after putting a few papers through it .
did not work in my printer
we buy these all the time from other suppliers tried this supplier for the first time and these are terribly made . they do not fold well and bend and break . not buying again
yes i did recieve two but they broke within the first week of purchase . not too happy with this purchase .
one was unusable
would not even give it one star it did not work at all and was a waste of money . will never buy it again nor recommend it .
they were listed as compatable with a printer that they did not fit into .
it arrived wrinkled must see pic  . need to return .
is not a ledger
not as easy to handle as i thought it would be . the shape looks perfect but i like rectangular better because you have an edge .
need to clean printer head each time you replace a cartridge . epson will send a message that the ink is not genuine . nevertheless the ink is ok .
cheap looking .. so wrinkled i cannot even use
we bought it to use with book tape and it will not even cut it . save your money .
did not work on our hp printer very disappointed .
one of the caps on mine came broken rendering it unusable unless i use two hands forcing the cap to be stable .
they were listed as compatable with the wrong printer it did not fit i ended up needing the cartridge
ran out much faster than expected but print quality was factory quality . trying remanufactured high yield next .
i like it but it will not stay on cloth
these are really garbage . they are as strong as toilet tissue . they tear easily and will not keep your good safe .
flimsy and the answering component stopped working after three days .
i do not remember much about this printer since i no longer have it and did not like it .
this stuff is horrible . do not buy . seemed like a good deal until you get it and it does not work .
the display is awesome . the stickies do not stick well .
no instruct ions to mount it .cannot put it together
worked well for months then the battery stopped charging . i cannot even use this calculator anymore .
not as good as my last one from staples
the product says my chemical romance gerard way but on the actual case it is not even mcr or gerard . it is supernatural
i did not realize that these were not as flexible for my needs . they are strong if that is what you need
poor quality . only print less than pages then run out of ink . over charge
it came without an important part the company sent it out . i used it about six times and it broke . i threw it away ...
no matter what i put in they end up half gone after one printing
black ink does not work ...error messages
base unit is a little small if you have larger feet .
i do not feel that i get very many copy s
it came in on time it prints great but the sound it makes is horrible !!
this pen writes well enough and it is much better than my previous parker fountain pen however this is not a genuine lamy .
this pencil will still show up on photocopies unless you write very lightly .
a very basic unit but good for the money .
eh never ended up using stashed in a drawer somewhere ..
they arrive loose in a bag . one of the cartridges was expired and am getting error messages from my printer ink is expired !
takes long to get but works great
the elastic is no longer pulling back after about a month of use so far out of the whole bag
used them for a long time without any trouble . did get a leaker once and had to tear the printer completely apart to clean .
did not fit over a standard cubicle wall . disappointed .
i guess i should have looked more carefully at the size . at x they are much bigger than i need .
the size is actually smaller than i had participated . we purchased this product for my father and it was tight on his fingers .
did not quite work right for some reason .
i have a inch tab it does not fit securely in the case .
sucks pen in the hose slides cannot really sharp it and i have to hold the pen make sure that is in the hole .
horrible nothing like what i expected it to be . it does not stick right and is made of aluminum bends easily . not a very good product .
used it twice and stopped working  .
crap . probably good as a treasure chest prize for rd graders .
the picture looks purpleish they are completely dark navy !!
never worked properly . too late to return it .
hooks smaller than expected using it for jewelry instead of clothes .
waste of money . does not do what it is suppose to do .
the color ens not the same as in the photo
i could not use wrong kind but already opened so did not return .
does not work well with refillable ink . would not buy again .
received used device . this unit did not really even charge . sent back
i can still use this but the plastic retention pieces that hold it together broke right out of the box . using duct tape to hold it together .
one of the cartridges was dry . i will not buy this product again .
unfortunately . these did not work at all . i threw them out and they ruined my printer so i had to buy a new printer . please be careful with this one
does not provide the microphone capability compatibility for the headphones i already have
cannot tell if they are doing anything at all .
pretty and a great concept but the glasses weighed the magnet down and fell off repeatedly . as much as i wanted it to work it just did not .
i got these for only dollars at a normal store ... i think this is very expensive for stylus pens 
cannot clean the board that good
work s !!!
all the months picture are the same . paid way to much for calendar ! not worth the money to send it back . go to wal mart or target .
returned for refund
lightweight . came cracked in a couple of places that do not effect functionality .
really good did everything i needed it to
would be nicer if they did not smear but they are just labels .
i am unable to use these cartridges because they do not fit my machine that uses hp these are hp xl .
one was defective we have not yet received the replacment ...
received the white board care and the bottle was over empty i did not see than any leaked out during delivery but not sure . thanks clint
description says pack but only received one pencil . false advertising . and this was an amazon prime item .
these markers came dried out . no fluid left in them . very disappointing .
the necklace was very nice for about a week then it fell apart .
false advertising !in photo there are file folders in case .let the buyer beware !
these book covers do not fit large textbooks .
it does not roll and stick correctly .
these suck will not hold up anything
very very poor quality !!!!! it is a total ripped off 
do not waste your money
does not line up with my printer .
very nice looks great but smaller than it looks on here .
liked it but too small for my hat 
first cartridges i put in were empty . hopefully the next two will be better
looks good but too large to fit comfortably in a hip pocket .
connector is too wide for the usb port on any of our pcs or laptops . what a waste of my time and  . do not buy .
use it for travel and as a nd scanner at my job . the wand part still has kinks but with the base no issues
did not fit my printer had to send it back .
cartridges were empty !
really good did everything i needed it to
great printer for a year . shortly after the warranty ended started to get inscrutable printhead ink failure now completely unable to print . now trying to decide whether it is worth getting fixed .
product was not new . appeared to be leftover book fair item with marks and blemishes .
very disappointed . three out of the six had brocken seams . one was cracked all the way down to the middle . these do not deserve any stars .
box works for most supplies but the demensions were not listed and it is a half inch too small on all sides .
except for the problem of putting them away and cleaning them off they work great . they stain easily . i tried using bleach and that did not do much .
the printer is always disconnecting from my router and has to be turned off and back on every time we print . i would not recommend purchasing this printer .
the black cartridges do not work well with our hp printer copier scanner . the two color cartridges are totally empty . one black is leaking inside its package .
i did not realize they were refilled cartridges . one cartridge had leaked . i am not impressed with the quality .
does not dry clear . extremely expensive for a poor product .
horrible printer . continual problems with wifi . gives error messages telling me to remove tape even with true lexmark ink cartridge . absolute waste of money .
my nd printer works good
prints super slow when printing in color .
slower return . need to refund credit .
broke on first try .
bulb only lasted days
nothing special
good cheap legal pads . i just wonder why amazon had a basics item was backorderd for weeks . was surprised when it showed up
if you have a brother mfc j dw do not expect these cartridges to work for you . they show that they are for this printer . waste of time and money .
only fits checks not a three fold piece of copy paper which is what my paystubs are written on .
no ! i had to send back because it was suppose to be ok to use with lexmark and it was not . it did not work
i smell a rat
got these to put on my car s bumper . these definitely do not go on the car . they fall right off . did not even last half a day .
they are very flimsy and the magnet is not that strong . i would not trust theses under my car like my old one  .
ink does not last long
shreds well and good price but way too loud !
buggy and very chintzy feel to it . had planned on using it for multiple sku and upc types inventories . returned .
it is only one sided . i thought it was flip sides  . disappointing .
an average chalk pen stopped working after a few times using it !
broke my wife s neck out
to small
terrible do not buy
only came as one pen in a ziploc bag . scam . getting my money back .
good quality mouse pad but the picture qualiry is not true color to the advertised picture
sadly it did not fit . either end could be inserted and connected but not both ends at the same time . it seems that the size is marginally longer than the original .
i thought it was three pencils for the purchase . i only got one .
extremely disappointed the books were bent and look for you had water damage ! please do not waste your money this is a lot of money to spend for trash like this .
ink is everywhere stained my hands and my desk ! i am just lucky i did not use it in the printer i would probably have had to replace it . trashed the rest !
not true cross cut . heavier unit then expected .
 month delivery new machine stopped working after ink was installed ink could not be used .
it works but how excited can one get over a cheap plastic paint pallet .
it is a little small but does not slide around like some .
delivered as promised . not yet installed into meter will report on performance once it has . al
these do not stick to my computer screen which was the only reason i bought them .
i wish i could rate this a zero . the product breaks with very little resistance . it will snap in pieces . worst tie i have ever used .
does not fit graphing calculators
kind of pricey but cheaper that in stores . hp products always milk you for the accessories .
when you try to cut the tape the opening closes . very annoying .
just ok microphone is not sensitive enough to capture all the sounds . pen has to kept close to the speaker and is barely audible
only one out of the three actually worded ! the others had no ink or something else was wrong with it . but anyway only one worked so i gtot ripped off
the pen is attractive but that is all good about it . it skips while writing . i even ordered jinhao cartridges in case my ink was the problem . still it does skip .
advertised as fiskars brand not fiskars .
very bad product . do not buy it . overheats and it is very weak .
item did not work out of the box product returnred
failed to work out of the box .
i . orders were red yellow and blue satellite transfer tracing paper and i recieved white instead of yellow .
disappointed have not decided to send back or not
ok for really temporary storage . cheap and nasty though .
some of them are not recognize by the printer some work good .
did not like it i gave it away and bought another one .
these toner cartridges smear and leak . this is especially the case with the magenta . i do not recommend .
it was what i would expect a case to look like . but it was a set of one . i assumed i would receive two cases based on the picture .
okay but not the quality of genuine !
it was to small
do not buy this ! it fell apart after week of little use ! heavy and basically useless ! 
i wish it was like my old phone with a blinking light when the phone company s answerer picked up a message .
printed a couple of pages and then so light that it was illegible . i have had similar results from many sellers .
back of hanging folders is open would be better if solid . paper can fall out of the back
it is a good garbage can for the kitchen
when reached were broken .
kind of wobble but does what its made to do !
beautiful and elegant but broke off within a week . chain is very fragile . i would not recommend buying this one not worth your money . stay away .
i bought these for classroom use and they are unraveling .
really good did everything i needed it to
cannot get phones to ring
after one year of use this is no longer working . worked fine for the first months .
not what i expected hope it holds up well
is doing as desired . however the back lite for the screen no workee .
did not come with the cable that was supposed to be included and it came without a manual . i want my money back please !!
insert space was too narrow to get the id card in it that i needed .
fell apart
ink was very light . could barely see
all three work but does not print smoothly . there are spaces and i even did the print head cleaning as well as the nozzle check several times ..
did not do as claimed for me
very thin . over priced .
this is  . for just board ? i ordered thinking from the product description that this would be a case of  . was surprised when i open the box and it only contained board .
flimsy dispenser tip does not feed well tape bunches up or lifts of the backing film and paper altogether . do not recommend .
very short life for ink cartridge
these do not work in my printer even though they say they are supposed to 
just a cheaply made chair . the instruction is awful . need my own tools to assemble .
it worked ok when i did have own it .
do not order this . it is flimsy and has roll marks on the plastic when it arrived . i could not use it as a desk pad as the description suggested .
pad area developed air bubbles but like it otherwise .
should have believed the reviews . sharp point makes for torn shirt pocket . item returned .
the sleeves for the credit cards are fine but passports do not fit in their sleeves . there is no way to get them in .
the grip part is off and not comfortable to hold . i really cannot see a child aged with a growing hand finding this comfortable
i installed the black cartridge and it worked for a little bit and now it will not print at all . very frustrated !
too steep only two positions cumberson
it is ok
poor quality . the magnet that is suppose to hold it closed is not even secured inside .
as advertised came punctual . the case does have slight bowing toward the center on all sides  .  .  .  . if that is a concern look somewhere else .
no where near fine point !
this did not work . the scan picture came out with streaks and lines everywhere . we calibrated it like the instructions said but did not work . very disappointed .
do not last .
this is a very nice box but i was expecting more for the money . to me its bulkier than it needs to be . i just feel its over priced .
not happy . you show it as a set in all of your photos . and only one small book arrived . way overpriced .
not as strong as i thought . still good product
ink came at levels that were almost empty with smearing everywhere . avoid this
upon opening the box one of the corner brackets was broken off .
are you kidding me ? i was expecting a dozen for this price . this is crap . will never buy again .
not the most hilarious card but can elicit a chuckle . good size .
this printer is the spawn of satan .
piece of crap . it jams paper continuously . i am throwing it out .
it took a while for my printer to recognize and accept these cartridges but after it did they print quite good . i am ultimately pleased with the product and price .
i would love this if it would stick to my fridge but it keeps falling off and scaring me so now itss just sitting on the window sill .
i likie the key chain but you only get one and you do not get to chose . i though from discription you would get  .
i guess i did not read the size of this but it is way too small for my needs i would send it back but already opened it .
the cord stopped working after like week .. and i am very dissapointed with it
do not buy remanufactured cartridges ! waste of money ! lesson learned
did not last very long about half the time of a new cartridge
not a wire cord buyer beware ! thanks for wasting my time .
worst color quality and a big mistake to purchase . you get black lines across when printing anything in full color . also the colors are faded and looks terrible .
i will be returning . it would not stick to my painted wall . what a disappointment .
i love the design but it is not very stable on the wall .
the headset works ok for the money but people had a hard time hearing me over the phone . i would not recommend for a professional environment .
awful ! did not work on my epson xp 
  . for this ? would not pay a dollar .
the product arrived defective and was returned for credit . will need to reorder soon .
too fragile ...it is not good quality for multiple pricing .
had it weeks already rusted the cable is about to break . great for someone who does not have to go outside . other wise do not waste your money !
spelling mistake on the badge although the badge looks good but no use to me will update later
does not work well and the holes were off line from where i needed .
not good
left side of mount noticeably sags . other than the sag it works fine .
instructions very poor making it difficult to use .
i bought thinking they were in binders boy was i wrong . i measured them when they arrived and they are actually in binders .
their okay .
coins get stuck easily .
sheaffer converters are a bit stiff and they are hard to clean .
expensive the real price should not be more than 
it is okay . a little chintzy for  .  . phone cord is very short and not quite the right shade of red .
total piece of junk fro hp . cannot even install it their support sucks .. no chat line .my biggest mistake was buying hp .do not buy this printer
hello is this computer or calculator como with the software suver pro .
good product for the price and as advertised .
wanted a bible bag . this was too big
i messed up it was cheaper at the local ace and i much prefer pneumatic tires . the guards over the tires are a nice feature though . i paid  .
i do not like it . cheaply made . the quality is well below what i expect from coach .
did not work in hp  . waste of money .
we do not like it as too small . need king size for my wife have low vision . could you find one big calculatater ?
not what i wanted .
only set of cartridges worked then the others my printer kept saying were wrong ones ...
works good
putting this into the locker for the first time broke off two hinges . no force or pressure was used . very flimsy
not worth the money . all but two of the signs had come apart from the stick and i had to hot glue them all back together ..
cyan and magenta overfilled and spilled on my hands when installing . then the printer did not recognize my cartridges . i got what i paid for .
bought these for my uniden phone just tried them today and they donot fit so do not waste your money threw them away today
cheap kit sent back
had to re punch these dividers as they did not fit a standard ring binder . waste of my time .
colors described as random however received all of the same color ...had to return .
tiny bit of duct tape exhorbitant shipping
be sure to understand mini here . these are barbie size and probably great for craft projects doll house stuff . otherwise no use whatsoever .
it is good
is not an actual chalk board chalk does not come off !
horrible customer service ! the keys stopped working so i called customer support over months ago and the guy flat out did not want to help me
the alarm is not very loud . it is not easy to hear
alarm too weak impossible to hear when the keys are in pocket or a box
garbage  !!! none of the control buttons worked did not recognize scan disk and customer service went to voicemail and they never called me back . sent back to amazon  !!!!! 
definitely not heavy duty ! very thin and light . the bubbles pop way too easily . sheets do not tear cleanly at the perforations . i do not recommend this
the battery pack came with one defective battery
i got this as added product protection i never had because to use it  . i guess it was ok to have
 weeks old and the reflective coating melted . the brightness started fading away within hrs . of use
call block needs to be larger
very weak magnetism
item had had batteries left in and corroded all terminals . an attempt was made room clean but does not power up .
cam dried out . never worked
i thought i was getting all colors . could not tell from the pictures or descriptions .
cheap not very magnetic
did not expect all the warnings about ink will register as empty on the printer while it is actually full 
i really wanted to love these and they work fine but the ink just is not as pitch black as some other brands i have used .
do not buy very cheap product
these cartridges are not recognized by my printer . i have an epson xp . very disappointed .
do not waste your money got the black to work but my printer will not even run with the color cartridge in .
ended up throwing them out when i was done . would probablly work well with small how clean up and stains but as an artist it was a very bad idea .
the stand shakes whiles typing
does not work ... rip off
good the price but slow to start printing . usb also interferes with other usb flash when using multiconnection
it fell apart on nd day i had it
these were suppose to fit my cannon mx  . they do not even come close and now i am past the return date . company is clearly uninterested and impossible to contact .
eh what can i say ! its a bag of penny rolls . does what its supposed to . buy these if you need paper rolls .
item was supposed to arrive th nd and is now pushed back to the 
my own fault i thought i was getting wireless but was a good buy and prints fine .
one was broken and the other leaks . not recommended .
i did not realize these were only half pages i am returning this item .
fur started falling out shorty after opened from package . but bigger than expected
ink did not flow . could not work
tried the black ink cartridge . it printed exactly two and a half pages and has not deposited a drop of ink since . i have run the head cleaning over and over .
not the highest quality i had hoped for but it is okay .
died after shredding about pages . did not last more than a week . was shredding standard office paper no more than sheets at a time .
does not even cover the entire screen . you can see the uncovered screen from the sides .
item was not as described and it appeared used .
worked well at first but recently is breaking the lead in my colored pencils . not sure if it is the sharpener or my pencils were dropped .
dried out quick
stop and look ............what a rip off  !!! i got two folders instead of one pack .... worst third party seller
very poorly made . broke after months . will not buy again .
after having it for less than weeks this happened . i guess you pay for what you get my recommendation is spend a little more and buy better ones .
it was a bit dissapointing that these sometimes stop writing and you have to scribble to get the ink out other than that they are a bit bigger than i expected and very kawaii !!
love the prints but very disappointed in how they were packaged . they now have a crease that shows .they came folded
out of worked correctly . it does the job very simple and effective . would have give it  . stars if all worked .
the blue and the black have left dots on every page and i cannot get them off so i will need to spend more to buy new toner again
part of the cover looks a bit shredded . does not look like it was made with good quality
did not last very long ....... letter was too thin . the seams ripped .
really slow and takes forever to print out
the picture is not the product you receive do not buy this .
very disappointed . the back cover of these binders cracked near the spine after very slight use . will not purchase again .
this thing sucks ! it randomly stops printing for no reason .
the board does not wipe off if you use a chalk pen . it came chipped and the stand was broken .
this color cartridge was defective . did not work at all .
the black ink plugged up our printers . the color was fine . we had to spend additional money and time to clean printers to get black out . i would not buy again .
junky and confusing . panasonic should be doing better .
felt like i was replacing the ink more than i was actually printing .
it was smaller that what my daughter thought .
i actually liked the paper mate comfortmate better than these for feel in the hand and smoothness of writing .
it works and it is serving its purpose as i type . however it is very cheaply made and i will have to replace the plastic holders before too long .
it only works half the time ... really annoying
thought it would be much bigger and less cheap looking . can probably only fit pens maybe less .
jam jam jam unless you only put a small handful at a time . so annoying !!
if it was possible i would rate this zero stars because it is a fake . the nib is off center and the laser cut letters are clearly not up to par .
the day planner is of great quality for the price however the pages and spaces in which to write events or plans are too small for my personal taste .
after two uses papers the color tank goes out of ink waste of money . i have to buy original ones .
worked well for five minutes then the laser pointer started fading to a tiny barely noticeable pin point .
some of the envelopes were stuck together and needed to be taped shut .
clip is too small to serve a purpose .
the colors that i received were not the ones in the picture . they were pastels instead of bold bright colors . good product but just not the colors i wanted .
my bad i did not realize these had the breast cancer logo all over them . not their fault but make sure this is what you want before ordering .
this book is not a x as the info states !
it did not come with a master key and it is locked ! if the seller would get back to me and send me the master key that would be greatly appreciated !
leaks a lot
what a waste of money . i should have read more of the reviews . i just opened and installed the new in cartridges and my printer shows they are empty .
not jumbo at all !!! this was not at all what i expected or ordered . not even bigger than a regular pushpin .
the black cartridge did not work . had to return item
just fair . did not care for the sharpener .
get a rock with a screw hinge . back is flimsy and does not really secure keys with high degree of confidence fall out easily .
the paper is thin and rips easily . the color comes off when you rub the paper to flatten it .
it is work ok .
love the design but i think the backing is too sticky that when you remove a page some stickiness remain on the front sheet of the next page .
has small splinters on the edges on both sides making it difficult for a pencil to glide smoothly and draw a straight line . might be ok for measuring but not for drawing lines .
did not work in my epson workforce  . waste of money .
bought set of on and one would not keep the charge months afterward .
very heavy
unhappily this uniden was defective . it was returned
very very small .
software is kind of goofy
very poor quality . i thought i was ordering a nice hardbound notebook . the paper is super thin the notebook itself is considerably flexible . not a good choice . super disappointed .
i just do not like newsprint . it is too fragile .
i do not like the color beacuse is more red .
useless .......went in the garbage .
i found after i used for a bit it jams up which is a pain
super flimsy folders offers no protection against bending . very thin plastic .
smaller than i expected but my main issue is one of the guppies molly had a large hole in the neck stitching .
not put together well . the whole thing comes apart when you take the cap off .
the zipper fell off because it was not sewn closed . oh well . it is pretty cool .
not compatible with printer as advertised waste of money
not at all happy with brother products ribbon may be fine but typewriter and labeler are bad to horrible  ...!!!
hated it unable to get the wifi to work .
completely under the impression i was getting a pack of these pens .... not pen for over  .
order two only received one
broke the day i received it .
good size smooth writing good top clear cover ... but they do not stick !! i had to hold this label with scotch tape ... which kind of defeats the purpose .
not printing must be dried out or something . going to try running cotton swab under cartridge today as someone suggested .
feels nice and all but still looks like something cheap that you buy from china
should be more blades in a pack
no way to hang it on the wall very cheap plastic . what a mistake i threw it away !
works great on some types of paper and colored pencils and not so well on others . i do like the thin edges of the eraser which allows one to erase exactly where needed .
this was received as a promo . overall it looks and feels pretty nice . one downfall would be the size double check before ordering !
installation instructions includes several different models of whiteboards . and the whiteboard does not come pre drilled . recommend purchasing different mounting brackets as the ones included do not function properly .
the cartridge was not recognized by my printer and cannot return it .
zipper on the inside pouch broke within the first ten minutes of opening the package . will be returning it .
sounds very low
it does help some .
pockets too small cannot fit papers in it
did not work when i received it . had to send it back .
did not fit the table and it was too late to return it .
does not scan to the cloud .
not as good as our last machine and cost more ! beeps errors repeatedly on good bills hopper barely holds bills . will not buy again .
arrived broken
stolen
did not fit in filing cabinet correctly .. older filing cabinet
horrible ideal for a bookmark . does not do its job  . would return if they were not trying to charge me same price i almost paid for it
printer cartridge did not work at all
same here this product is not is not worth the buy !
just fair .
if you want specific sizes buy box of that size i have like half of the box left because they are big enough to fit on toes .
the product is inferior . the instructions are not clear .
very cheap made . fell apart in the first few days of using .
delivered within expected time frame . ink cart works normally .
cheaply made get what you pay for
i would give a negative review if i could . nowhere it says it does not comes with cartridge ! waste of time and money .
just what i needed
misleading picture . you only get pad . very disappointed
reconditioned  ....ink must have been dry ...had to destroy . have requested a refund .
almost better to buy genuine .
okay but long shipping wait and not sturdy at all
pretty but not for daily use
i am glad to see that these cartridges last much longer than the regular ones
very flimsy not strong material . it will hold up for a light badge or a single key . also the length is shorter than my last one .
not recognized by my mfc j dw . do not buy .
the stickers look good at first but fade and peel in the weather ........sun and rain
very entertaining
did not work in the printer like it said it would
the picture does not represent correctly the size of the rubber bands . package was delivered all crumbled up . i do not return it because it is not worth time and money .
the assembly directions were difficult to read and follow . after assembly the stand is okay .
it works fine for what i need but do not expect fort knox the keys and lock are very flimsy .
works o .k . i really expected better buttons kind of small but could be good for some .
not sure this works .
it is only one not  . do not buy it .
not working correctly after months . cord seems to have a short or something in it .
does not work
would give zero if i could .
installed and it did not work would like an exchange .
needle size whole cannot gat any suction on it had to drill the whole bigger and broke two drill bits doing it
i love love love the planner and suzy toronto . however the book itself was bent and looked used .
too little . gave it away
do not buy very cheap product it leak s and will ruin you printer
ok for the price but sadly lacking compared to my old vtech ! sound quality is not very good but it is a cheap unit and falls short of my old uniden .
t total crap of a pen skips misses it is like writing with an obamacare designed pen . if you have a choice use a quill dipped in blood
did not work
compass would not calibrate ..... sent back
i ordered a size and got a size  . this is the rd one i have ordered and all are exactly the same size even though i ordered different sizes . very disappointed !
stopped working after a couple weeks of use .
missing a pen and never received it . they are cute though perfect for stocking gifts or party favors .
the color ink does not work at all . the printer accepts the black but it comes out horrible . horrible purchase . it is not even worth the shipping money to send back .
it did not meet my expectations .
this is not even the original design . it is a shitty mock up design that falls short of accuracy in color and respect of the original logo . waste of dollars .
well pleased
product was expired
the drum unit failed after only days and pages . however my money was quickly refunded .
phone cord does not work . wires crossed in it or something . tou hear yourself speak instead of the party calling you .
needed this for my whiteboard but do not want to use the sticky tape . will need to find another way to secure it .
the cartridge is leaking
it is ink . why does it have to be so expensive ????? come on epson how much money do you really need from me ? give us a break .
i ordered the wrong ink for my printer . we have a place that recycles computers that i hope will accept it .
it is not that sharp and jams when opening envelopes .
waste of money . did not work in my epson workforce  .
to expensive for what i got . bought pretty much the same thing at the dollar store which was good for a year old 
not user friendly
strange writing on cover poorly translated . returned the item .
this is not blue ! it is black ink .
this product is a joke . my husband used it for days and it fell apart ! the pins holding it together just snapped . stay away from this horrible cheap gartbage .
ok for the money needs better style  .  .  ..
fake chinese carbon paper stuffed in a spirit brand box . do not waste your money stencils bleed and wipe right off !
horrible stopped working shortly after i bought it
my hp printer would let me use re manufactured ink .
horrible never seen an inside of a folder made so crappy !
really disappointed . really poor print quality and after about weeks the printer stops recognizing the cartridges causing me to need to replace them . back to authentic cartridges for me ....
probably my problem . it burnt out the phone .
the package arrived really quick ! however the color is not that strong at least not these cartridges ...
did not even last a week very upset !
my hp printer will not let me use a refilled cartridge . sob sob 
too large and bulky  .. also too many different places to add information .. when looking for something simple this is not it .
received item and it was broken
good product for the price and as advertised .
