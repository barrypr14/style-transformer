worked about a month then died
the phone did not work . no dial tone . not worth the cost to return .
not laminated and no reinforced holes for hanging . will be returning .
cartridge was over filled black smears on paper every time i tried to use it . refund was quick though .
returned it hard to open and get it into place a bit flimsy would not purchase again based on how hard it was to set up and take down .
uneven wobbles discolored ... do not feel like returning
nice quality . happy with the item
did not work ....period .
do not stretch for jr high books  ..was a fail
not genuine lexmark ink . when i used it my print quality deteriorated . lexmark technical support advised use of the product voided my warranty and precluded them from offering any assistance .
the batch i had exploded all over when i tried to use them and i did follow the instructions . i ended up returning them for a less messy alternative .
very cheaply made . doubt they will last through the year .
these just did not hold together  ... many broke before using and many broke very soon !!
it is ok but considering the price plus shipping is expensive for what you get . it is not worth  .  . it is not so big and the quality is just ok .
did not recieve a sharpener . just blades .
this did not work . unable to hear or make a call when this was attached . waste of money buying this .
was not a prepaid refill card as shown  . it was a gift card not the same thing .
did not fit into my holder .
it is a piece of trash  !!!!!
adequate .
i thought i was buying cases of for  . per case . this is a very cheap product and not worth  . per individual box .
basic cordless phone . screen hard to read and it does not show how many missed calls in caller id
once the first lead runs out it is trash because the next one will not come out no matter what . and refills will not go in . bad design and waste of money .
quality reflected by he price . placard on top where it says man cave is not attached and it is pretty thin . but het it is a nice gift for the basement
we ordered about of these and of them had slits in them in various places when they arrived and are unusable . very disappointing !
thought it would be better quality just looks like someone printed it from home
it is nice works well . does hat it advertises
very thin will choose a thicker product the next time .
rhinestones fell off after about weeks
low pressure air ..then they die .
terrible product . total scam . do not purchase
sometimes cover does not put ipad to sleep
i did not receive what is pictured . i received yellow and pink .
failed to be delivered as promised ... disappointed on that .
i am a little disappointed in these phones . the battery in one has already gotten very weak and only provides a very short talk time before it starts beeping .
so disappointed the pen was in its box but fell off the seat of my car on the pavement and broke before i even had a chance to try it out .
staples were fine . good quality . just too wide for my swingline deluxe heavy duty stapler .
it appears big on the website but it is actually tiny
have not used color cartridges yet but black is light grey . won t be able to use for anything outside of home use . not good enough for document printing resume etc .
very flimsy placed in binder and half of them cracked at rings had to reinforce and tape . will not buy again .
the picture is so dark . other than the pis it is mostly black . i would not recommend .
product keeps rolling up . does not stay flat on surface .
the letters i received are not inches . they are about inches . disappointed because i needed larger letters for a larger bulletin board !
we lost our other one . then the day this one arrived we found the other one . far to lazy to send this one back . have since misplaced this one .
had to send back . no monthly tabs or calendar before each month . who makes a planner without those ??
cheaply made . runs out of ink quick .
my lexmark print quality deteriorated after installing . i called lexmark technical support and they advised that the ink was not genuine lexmark thereby voiding the warranty and preventing them from providing any assistance .
my brother printer does not detect these cartridges ...need to return .
great !!!
cheap vinyl like feel . not worth a quarter of the price paid .
i understand their concept as to why they print their logo on the paper but even when inked it appears through . not a fan and prefer identical papers that lack this feature 
was not the one shown in the pic
cheap phone cannot hear out of it very well and not a good range .
great quality bad design . once you get the case a little more than half way full it will not shut . i guess you get what you pay for .
i liked the idea but the fox head was separate from the pom . hung strange on my bag that way ...
it has a small dent in the pen ...
so far one has not worked waiting to see if the others do .
the roll was punctured and damaged ...had to dump nearly ft ....
a little bigger than i thought it would be but still fits in my scrubs pockets .
does not work !!! wanted all my money back and they ignored me !!
came with a stain !
very bad quality .
this did not have a crisp enough image to satisfy me the pervious paper i had used was light years better . this is not suitable for crafts as it fades quickly and curls
did not do the job
for the december page it was an upside down september repeat .
they are smaller than i expected .
good feel and very nice looking fountain pen . however it leaks a lot ... this pen stained of my pants and one of my shirts .
two of the cartridges were completely unusable .
outdated ink does not work
does not work
first one out of the bag broke . i pulled the red one out and snap ! plastic broke on the inside .
way too flimsy unless that is what you need . they have one that is better i am exchanging and getting those .
wrong size for our unit even though it is listed on the pkg
not legit .
horrible ! i bought this as a backup and could never get it to work . completely useless waste of money and materials .
these markets are absolutely terrible . they do not even show up on my dry erase board .
as a year accountant it is the worst adding machine i have ever used . too many strokes needed for a basic calculation .
is not white . when making corrections fluid is off yellow . threw it away . when i copied error stood out terribly .
this is not the best but it is doable for those who are you taking things just for themselves . pieces fall apart and it is not starting
thinner than i expected
how about a  . star ? to get the paper to unwrap the tip i had to pull it down like layers . at that rate the will go fast .
very small . does not insulate well
my son seems to like them .
terrible . box open . pieces fell out . not usable .
too complicated but it is a landline so the price was okay .
the zipper broke the first day of school cheaply made obviously
overpriced !
it did not last long it breaks .
item arrived with scratches and dings on the base plate .
suck . dried out in less than a day . spend the money for the brand name ones .
took over a month to receive . light weight and feels cheap
do not buy . leaked inside and destroyed my printer . i literally had ink leaking out of my printer . horrible save yourself the headache and do not buy this junk .
does not accommodate page protectors which it why i got it . otherwise great little binder just disappointed that it is not wider to allow for page protectors and tab dividers .
i m sorry that not the same who i want .
i learned to my chagrin that this refill is too small in length . mine takes the pelikan 
poor quality for the price .
ok but expensive
very dissatisfied ! very cheap looking and the material was wrinkled . i sent b it back !
do not buy this for any reason
cheap and small . get what you pay for .
not one of these have worked and i am on my th .....not red ink will come out ....prints in blues and yellows if you are lucky 
i guess i do not know what i was expecting but for half the price you can grab a smaller notebook with pocket dividers write list at the top of each page .
i am not crazy about this product . it does not always work and there is really no way to fix it .
ink got all over my hands will not buy again
color is not at all like what is shown in photo . they are bland colors not bold or neon as described .
works fine for the phone
did not fit my cross pen
product did not hold up to expectations !!!!!
coloring is more yellow . very fake looking
hard to assemble and just not a good product
not a good product .
did not work on my xp  ! had to return
broke easily ...
i have ordered newest version but of them are old grey version
i thought they are like nice vintage look newspapers that i can use as wrapping paper but it was nothing like that . many colors and many advertisement of shoes and food . yuck .
hard to sharpen pencils . the sharpener is one sided so colored pencils tend to get smashed on one side .
smaller than i expected
not please with this at all does not work .
this gaff tape does not leave and residue which is cool but it also does not stick very well . it is pretty weak .
do not buy poor quality .the zipper is defective .
it is a battery . it worked .
a little too thin
not compatible .
forgot how awful old xp games are .
product came with dents on the board and the marker was dried out cracked .
leaked toner into machine . stripes on copies run through feeder . terrible . i have learned my lesson and will buy brother oem toner .
was not what i wanted
your quickie did not do anything for me ! the springs just popped out and all the fluid leaked out too quickly ! bad design !
not an exact replacement . works ok on non photo type material . on photo paper pictures are washed out . get the original cartridge for best photo printing .
i do not like the quality or the fact that there are no tabs identifying each month separately . so i have order a hard back version .
stopped using this because the grip part is super uncomfortable .
the staple does not punch tight enough ...
absolute garbage calendar . came extremely poorly packaged and is super thin paper
it does not come with everything shown
ink ran out and was skipping lines right away
can barely hear playback beware this phone
 plus dollars and i only got one design !!!! do not waste your money !!!!!!!
i bought this hoping to use it as my new planner but the ink bleeds through and now my journal looks messy .
did not fit
i like the case but it can use some improvements on the kickstand . it is a bit difficult to open the kickstand .
good product
i bought this and after weeks they all broke not good . i will not buy it again .
it did not come with any lead so i guess i am supposed to buy the pencil on line then run down to the store and buy some lead ?
junk just cardboard box buy a plain box save 
so far good . it sometimes stops in the middle of printing and then continues to print
not worth the money .
not nearly powerful enough and does not shoot very straight .
pen part pushes back into cylinder
too expensive . better deal at staples
this product does not fit mfc j dw
does not charge my electronics when plugged into the car .
paper shedder no longer works .
i like it
too tiny regular pencils will not fit will have to wait til they are used or find an alternate use ... too bad as they are cute 
great cover and play on the famous phrase . interior a bit of a let down .
broken into pieces when received
poorly balanced . leaky and irregular ink flow .
just installed toner cartridge . seem operational .
does not work .
does not stick very well in colder temperatures .
poor quality materials .
pretty design nib troubles
my printer started having problems with the print head after i installed this ink . i did read warnings about this happening though so i guess it is my own fault
sort of works at first . then just throw this crap away and buy the real cartidges .
it did not work at all it did reproduce images that represented the slide but they absolutely very low quality
cheap pens but super cute
wow the pen broke and we tried to have mont blanc repair it and they told us it was counterfeit ! i hope someone stands behind this purchase !
i bought a refurbished unit to manage my documents ... i broke after two months of light usage . guess next time i am buying a new one .
not as good quality as i expected but i will use them .
flimsy
highly disappointed with my order half of the pens i received are broken .
do not buy . not working after a month . not recommend .
very thin will choose a more durable envelope in the future .
gel highlighters are the worst . you cannot get the accurate width in highlighting and they functions like wax crayons leaving tiny gel stuff all over .
works as should
looks almost the same as the picture but badly made .
did not have remoistened flaps
i have not been able to punch the sheets as advertised . i am lucky to get or in without it getting stuck . a brand new machine should not have these issues .
the phones only worked for about a month and then would not communicate with my cell phone . i do credit the supplier they did give me a refund .
worked days and blew out
it is sturdy but it is not gray it is filing cabinet beige colored
with new black cartridge it says black ink low and cannot print black docs ? less than a year old
these would not stick on plastic in high humidity summer outdoors  .
it probably is a nice game but my kids did not like it too much . ages  . they like playing with the stick figures though .
it stopped working in three months
they are batteries and they worked .
these were already expired when i received them . not too happy about that but so far they seem to work just fine .
like looking in a funhouse mirror . reflection is very distorted .
just what i needed .
clamps seem to strip out when tightening even medium size sets of plans . works great for lighter sets .
not what i was wanting
more for home use
color cartridge did not work in my printer
poor product quatlity ! printer failed to recognize that the shipping lock had been removed .
low price . works for what we need .
not what i expected  . bigger than the picture and does not work well .
black ink is good . i am having trouble with the printer reading the colored cartridge so i can not use it .
looks so cheap .
did not charge my razr v when connected to any usb charger . did charge the phone only when connected to a pc . why motorola why ?
too bubbly .
stars are only for arrival time . product in its self was basic and was intentionally ordered for that purpose .
read the fine print . assorted does not mean that you can the same number of every color .
i am happy with the print quality wireless setup and everyday use . the rating lost stars because you cannot print anything if a color is out of ink .
i cannot get these to work without crinkling . was much happier with the scotch brand thermal laminating pouches and will order those again instead .
not apple compatible .
home use only really does not hold up well to above average use . really needs used with premium staples .
too small
the cartridge fit into my printer but it would not let me print at all kept saying low ink replace cartridge .
finally arrived the pkg was torn and pencils were sticking out .
is not always reliable to print wirelessly
my tween girls each used one of these to start the school year . both girl s pouches lasted less than a week . the zippers broke on both used .
my five year old can write a more exciting novel .
great paper quality but my optical mouse does not respond well on it . looks like this will be just a note pad for me
they did not because only one of them work and the other one did not work ......
all cartridges needed to be returned . poor performance
did not work at all send it back
the description says and it is  . it does not fit in the spot i had intended to hang it
unfortunately this was not desired size but we kept items to prevent trouble of returning . we were looking for normal size x  . thank you .
necessary evil .
not the greatest . seems to be made . but i guess you get what you pay for . it does work
ink was not as dark as i would like but they did write smoothly .
not good at all so hard to puch front wheel does not work  .iam returning this product  .i was disappointed  .i do not recommend this product
not as we thought . not really pro . just ok and we returned for different mead style .
very cheap quality arrived with sticky stuff on cover . had to return
met my expectations . thanks !
my son loves the dimondbacks . got for back to school . great product but the wholes do not line up with a ring binder .
the case is great . unfortunately the tripod was not so good . i used it twice and it broke .
they write slightly nicer than the bic multipens but leak like fiends . i just opened this pen this morning . so glad i did not toss it in my handbag ! 
necessary evil .
the wrist pad was too thick making mouse use uncomfortable
did not work in printer . destroyed the printheads . had to clean heads times and different ink to fix printer . do not purchase
not worth it
the check book cover is great .
so slow but gets the job done
was good bought this back in so times have changed but it did an okay job of what it was supposed to do . did break a few months after .
will not make this mistake again . the printer would not recognize any of the cartridges .
this tape does not stick !! not even to itself !!
cheap resin pen that does not even come with one refill
the magnet is not strong enough and the eraser slides downward
arrived with a piece cracked off
have not had these long enough to make evaluation
have not figured out how to use it yet no instructions
two of the house names were misspelled . also the quality of the pins is really cheap .
despite what the description says these do not fit an hp deskjet printer send them back for a refund and have yet to hear from them or get the money back .
nice basic case nothing fancy . seems to work well for holding it securely sleep function works well with magnet .
not practical at all .
not worth it
too long for my men s wallets .
seems to be running out of ink after a few uses . i guess you get what you pay for .
not worth price ....
not sturdy . awful
pens leaked all over each other . some were dried out .
a little flimsy but will get the job done .
after one use the black did not work . i have ordered refills before and never have i had this happen .
tiny and expensive but what other choice do you have ?
it tends to get stuck to the monarch price gun . great color  .
these tab do not stick out far enough to be seen past the sheet protectors . will not order again .
i like the phone except for the fact that i find it very difficult to read the telephone number of any incoming calls .
it did not make our tv work so we are not sure if its the bulb or something else with the tv .
too big for an average wallet .
could not focus the image . entirely useless projector too bad because my hopes were high for summer movie nights in the backyard .
the zipper broke after i used it twice
not a chalk marker !!! ruined stained my chalk board .
bought this exact calculator at dollar tree today . do not waste your money on this over priced calculator !
this was a replacement to a like printer . it did not work and the company is giving me a hard time about returning it .
wheels do not roll through dry sand well at all .
not sticky at all
my phone came to me defective every time i tried dialing a number it would give me a dial tone each time this is suppose to be a new phone .
wish the mobile app was better .
it did not work with my printer even after attempting all of the troubleshooting . however office depot did take it back i exchanged it for a real hp so that made me happy .
stick w the wheel
the first pages come out darkened . the toner leaks and makes all the colors awful .
fade in the sun and then curl up .....not worth the money
the markers are very waxy and do not adhere to the surface very well the light colors are not visible at all . will not purchase this particular brand again .
awkward ... heavy .
their product may be great but i did not get to use it . the item i purchased it for was returned because it did not work .
this cartridge was bad and would not work in the printer . i had no idea how to return it so i am stuck with it . the color cartridge hp worked just fine .
i cannot get this to work . has no instruction in box
my by id will not fit and the back is solid not clear as in the photo so will not work if you need see both sides of id .
four way connectors hard to find locally
slides on carpet easily . not a happy buyer !
not sure where the problem lies but the lexmark printer rejects these cartridges as incompatible . disappointing .
not worth the money .i am very unhappy with this item i had issues with it right away .then the screws broke off .warning
i like it but my printer is objecting
stopped working next day
all good
the ink cartridge is not aligning correctly so anything that is printed is completely distorted .
too small and i weigh lbs
unfortunately they are not reliably sticky . they do not stick to a paper bag lunch bag style . they do stick fairly well to plastic bags .
bought two . one worked one did not . not a great track record .
not sure if the packaging sparks off the feeling on it being original  . but it writes very well nonetheless .
speed up broken in bits
they were mini clothes pins that are good for nothing . i threw them in the garbage .
drum worked properly for less than a month . absolutely a scam .
will return . not compatible
not a fan . the ink does not flow smoothly enough for my taste . it does have a nice thin tip however which i like .

i ordered one set and and i received sets
functionall
lasted months . i would not buy from them again .
printer hp kept rejecting it
just seems to smear does not take it off the board .
these break very easily . i bought them for my kindergarten daughter s name tag . we used them all within the first week and a half .
worked for a while but then started printing to light to read .
terrible . straw was unraveling and i had to pay the return cost ! i will not be buying from these people again .
i tried attaching the elmer s freestyle container to several areas on my car ranging from moderately textured to smooth and it just would not stick cons not sure how it works ??
it would have been perfect if there was a piece to hold the roll of tape in the tape dispenser area . returning it unfortunately ...do not have rigging capabilities .
too wobbly .
one side came scratched up otherwise it would have been perfect .
it ran out after only a few pages . would not purchase again .
failed after just months sad face ...
its ok .... but i do keep having issues with the display going wacky . i am not sure why . i have changed the batteries .
the hard plastic bit at the top of the holder that you use to attach it to your cable broke on me in day and the item is ineligible for exchange return .
too small for my fingers but cool to the extent to which i am able to use it .
flimsy and too big
thin paper and dull color .
it was not nec brand but grc and when i changed ribbons it was not much darker than what i had in it . i was not very satisfied .
save my a lot money yes but one cartridge was empty .
will not charge quality is very poor do not order this lemon
nothing to rave about and smells kind of weird

prints with gray streaks and blotches in the background .
duplex and off hook are terrible
they do not write most of the time .
very flimsy broke in less than a week of use .
unable to open the drawer because the shelf above it is not straight . good idea but poorly made .
it was nice . thought it was going to be a little nicer
did not work right out of the box . we already through the box away so we cannot return it .
unfortunately this toner started going bad almost immediately printing dark pages to the point you could not read text anymore .
the treasure box is well made but super wide and tall . a bit bigger than i needed .
very cheaply made locks do not move at all when trying to set combination very disappointed .
did not get the right amount .
others are correct it will only work once or twice well . it did work well enough the first time .... it was worth it only working once for me . 
one of the cords has already quit working after using it for about weeks
it was not what i thought it was the spaces were to small ... i needed one that i could write in other than appointments and dates

rhinestones fell off after weeks
tittle is misleading i only received the keyboard wrist pad and not the mouse wrist pad ....

not worth it . fur came off the next day after one used . the noise it makes is very annoying .
ink cartridges print just no indication of remaining ink levels .
item looks bigger in picture . would not have bought it if i knew how big it truly was .this countdown calendar is about the size of an index card .
thei paper cutter was bought for my classroom . it does not cut through the paper . half way down it snags the paper and will not cut it . so sad !
requires ubiquiti controller . this was not stated in the description .
magnet is not very strong . i put whiteboard markers in it but it will not hold many without falling .
very bulky and poor quality .
to flimsy for my use too small . wanted to use these to practice drawing shapes . these are great for children though just what product was designed for .
cap s delay a little to much
not worth it
it is a little less sturdy than the previous version i bought but it works .

dimensions not as stated in the description .
it has more scratches than expected but works ok
worst printer ever .

the ink flaked off a bit .
phones do not register or link up to the base so they do not work !

arrived cracked and i returned it . its also extra wide as evidenced by the image  . wider than i needed .

smaller then i thought they would be
after one use the black stopped working . i know it is a refill but when i have bought refills before they have lasted longer than one use
the cartridge straight out the box starting streaking and once cleaned it come back . really need a replacement .
unbalanced off center nose piece on several of the glasses i received .
seems to be running out of ink after a few uses . i guess you get what you pay for .
prints horrible .
good black ink . but i guess it is expensive a little
i purchased this lanyard and within about a week it left a black line on the back of my neck . very disappointing .
this was  . x not open . to big .
has a tendency to break easily .
it did not work with my work phone which is very old . i will see if it works on my landline at home .
just ok .
labels work as expected the seem to bend from the heat in some printers .
this was not as stated in the question and answer . it is and i am returning it . be careful .
product did not work on delivery . the printer would jam after sheet of paper went through but there never was a jam . had to go to cartridge world for a new drum .
lasted around days until the keyring section irreparably severed from the coil . piece of crap i should have bought something more expensive and better made . will never buy from this company again .
hard to work with . little complicated to city name search and other options . if you planing to use it for business not a good option to work with .  .
this is a small stop i needed a large stop .
the map was too small for my taste .
does not snap in
not my favorite but it doesn the job .
i really like this product just wish the grass section went all the way down . my pens fall out all the time because they only go less then half way down .
did not look close . week starts on monday which is a little awkward for me .
the ink cartridges leaked all over the inside of my printer ultimately ruining the printer .
flimsy
would not work with my printer ..
it was not what i expected
i am still using the pen and have not refilled yet ...
 love it 
i thought this was a us company but they come out of china deceptive .
you might as well put your money in the paper shredder . this breaks so easily that unless you plan on writing on clouds there is no point to buying this product .
i tried attaching the elmer s freestyle container to several areas on my car ranging from moderately textured to smooth and it just would not stick cons not sure how it works ??
they look absolutely nothing like the picture and the quality is very poor !
not a keychain . this is a pin .....
neither of these were compatible with my hp printer .
cute but months and weeks are misprinted and out of order .
pricey here but nice looking . holds its paper well .
as mentioned by other users after less than two years usage it shows b error which forces you to buy a new unit . what a shame !
first time glove was worn the fingertip was shredded making the glove unusable . waste of money . would never buy again . should be no stars .
i only received toner . that is all it came with . if i wanted a toner i would have paid half the price i did for it .
poor quality . one nail has got out of his place after days usage the one at the end of cheetah s head . still working
these flags came as advertised . they were just too big for the map i needed them for .
color was not right .
sleek design but not efficiency
my printer brother mfc j dw does not detect these ink cartridges . very unhappy .
this product does not work and also has a no return policy on it ...do not buy this  !!!
painfully slow not worth it at all .
the worst ever cartridges that i have seen . spoiled my printer leaked as soon as they are installed . do not buy them .
there is a secure seal however with it just above the perforated easy open area i accidentally tore the perforation when i was packaging necessitating additional shipping tape .
way too much money the cost has to come down dramatically
i was not able to use it because my printer would not recognize the ink . i am trying to return it .
the bulb has to be modified to fit though it lists as a replacement for the projector .
i bought this item and it did not work i tried to ask for a replacement one and this company did not offer one to me ! not happy about that
works well
does not work for our business . amazon support was wonderful better than the manufacturer .
one out of the four did not work ..other than that they get the job done .
the stickiness of the magnets barely holds anything . it would even hold a single piece of laminated paper to a whiteboard . magnet strength is poor as well .
works pretty good for about half a cartridge then starts to lose color
the black seems to work ok but the color ones either run out too quickly or my printer is having trouble figuring out they are there .
pens are cheaply made but ok for the price
the ink cartridges did not work for my printer . i returned them . quiet an incnvience .
be careful . this product is not quality standard gaffer tape . it left residue all over our stage .
it was a gift .
the sprayer did not have a hole in it so i had to go and buy a new one !!!
its ok but does not last to long . plastic inserts fall apart after six month of use . thank you . danny .
this markers do not work . i have two different chalk boards and these did not work for neither . wish i could send back
color ink does not work found out long time after purchase
has a large capacity lasted for the school year but barely .
a leak waiting to happen .
seem rather weak .
very poorly refilled toner cartridges . terrible print quality and speckling in a c that is only a few months old .
one of the legs plastic got all soft and it would not grip on anymore .
leak and smear
would not work .
some of the cartridges did not work
these cartridges do not work . the mess with the settings on your printer as well . so upset i wasted my money  !!
the paper does its job but i only got one of the three packs promised which was disappointing .
while convenient to choose which tab will stand up the others have to be tucked and i am not all that dexterous or patient . colors are bright and the folders feel solid .
low quality stuff . you get what you pay for
spews out too much ink .
worked fine for months then suddenly stopped working . not recommended .
well it prints ... but my printer still says its empty . i guess this toner and the printer do not play nice . but it does print .
good product good price .
these suck ! spend the money for the actual brand name ones
too small to be useful for me
hugely overrated broke jammed within the first weeks of use . horrible junk .
the stapler occasionally jams a bit disappointing that way .
ink was all dried up and did not work .
my first impression with this product it is overpriced and cheaply made . i have not taken a lot of time with it todate and i am hoping it will accomplish what i need .
really need to update picture . this is not the item you will receive if you order it . was very up set .
ver disappointed were all dried up before i could use them all .
holds lots of cards ....wish it had the security cover that we are forced to use so information is not stolen .
the cartridges do not work with my hp printer . the printer just does not accept these cartridges .
works ok still is messy to use it leaks price is cheap for its troubles .
product was defective . the tape and the transfer layer were spun wrong .
surprisingly cheap quality esp given price we returned headed over to staples in town instead .
phone would not port up
so messy and did not work for me the printer kept saying need name brand refills
do not buy you get what pay for i guess these ran out of ink immediately so obviously they were only partially filled . what a waste
product works but not getting performance of original cartridges .
no staples to start out !!
quality is poor
its very light ..simple ....but worthy for price
